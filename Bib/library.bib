abstract = {In this article, we discuss cognitive load measurement techniques with regard to their contribution to cognitive load theory (CLT). CLT is concerned with the design of instructional methods that efficiently use people's limited cognitive processing capacity to apply acquired knowledge and skills to new situations (i.e., transfer). CLT is based on a cognitive architecture that consists of a limited working memory with partly independent processing units for visual and auditory information, which interacts with an unlimited long-term memory. These structures and functions of human cognitive architecture have been used to design a variety of novel efficient instructional methods. The associated research has shown that measures of cognitive load can reveal important information for CLT that is not necessarily reflected by traditional performance-based measures. Particularly, the combination of performance and cognitive load measures has been identified to constitute a reliable estimate of the mental efficiency of instructional methods. The discussion of previously used cognitive load measurement techniques and their role in the advancement of CLT is followed by a discussion of aspects of CLT that may benefit by measurement of cognitive load. Within the cognitive load framework, we also discuss some promising new techniques.

abstract = {This study examined the influence of people's beliefs about the certainty of knowledge, the strength of their beliefs about a controversial issue, and their tendency to enjoy effortful thinking on their interpretation of controversial information. Ninety-six undergraduates completed an epistemological beliefs questionnaire (M. Schommer; see record [rid]1991-05940-001[/rid]), the Need for Cognition Scale (J. T. Cacioppo, R. E. Petty, {\&} C. F. Kao; see record [rid]1984-30417-001[/rid]), and indicated the degree to which they believed that HIV causes AIDS. They then read a text that presented two conflicting views regarding the HIV–AIDS relationship and wrote a concluding paragraph for the text. Regression analyses revealed that the less students believed in certain knowledge, the less extreme their initial beliefs, and the higher their need for cognition, the more likely they were to write conclusions that reflected the inconclusive nature of the mixed evidence they read.

Educational Researcher, 15(2), 414. Based on the work undertaken by the QUASAR project with middle school mathe- matics teachers, we engaged a group of seven high school mathematics teachers in learning about the Levels of Cognitive Demand, a set of criteria that can be used to examine mathematical tasks critically. Using qualitative methods of data collection and analysis, we sought to understand how focusing the teachers on critically examining mathematical tasks influenced their thinking about the nature of mathematical tasks as well as their choice of tasks to use in their classrooms. Our research indicates that the teachers showed growth in the ways that they consider tasks, and that some of the teachers changed their patterns of task choice. Further, this study provides a new research instrument for measuring teachers growth in pedagogical content knowledge.},

The authors frame the missing-data problem, review methods, offer advice, and raise issues that remain unresolved. They clear up common misunderstandings regarding the missing at random (MAR) concept. They summarize the evidence against older procedures and, with few exceptions, discourage their use. They present, in both technical and practical language, 2 general approaches that come highly recommended: maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian multiple imputation (MI). Newer developments are discussed, including some for dealing with missing data that are not MAR. Although not yet in the mainstream, these procedures may eventually extend the ML and MI methods that currently represent the state of the art.},

abstract = {This study examined epistemic metacognition as a reflective activity about knowledge and knowing in the context of online information searching on the Web, and whether it was related to prior knowledge on the topic, study approach, and domain-specific beliefs about science. In addition, we investigated whether Internet-based learning was influenced by epistemic metacognition and the individual differences examined. Seventy 8th grade students were interviewed retrospectively after searching for online information about the scientifically controversial topic of dinosaur extinction. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Findings showed that participants expressed reflections about the simplicity/complexity, certainty/uncertainty, source, and justification of knowledge at different levels of sophistication, according to three patterns of epistemic metacognition. Prior knowledge was not related to epistemic metacognition in the search context, while study approach and epistemic beliefs about science were associated significantly, although modestly, with aspects of online knowledge evaluation. Moreover, findings revealed that Internet-based learning was influenced by overall science-related epistemic beliefs. Learning from Internet sources was also affected by study approach and epistemic reflections about the justification of online knowledge, as well as by the interaction between beliefs about the justification of scientific knowledge and beliefs about the justification of the knowledge accessed concerning the topic.},

@article{Sandoval2005,
abstract = {It has long been a goal of science education in the United States that students leave school with a robust understanding of the nature of science. Decades of research show that this does not happen. Inquiry-based instruction is advocated as a means for developing such understanding, although there is scant direct evidence that it does. There is a gap between what is known about students' inquiry practices and their epistemological beliefs about science. Studies of students' ideas about epistemological aspects of formal science are unlikely to shed any light on how they perceive their own inquiry efforts. Conversely, inquiry-based instruction that does not account for the epistemological beliefs that guide students' inquiry stands very little chance of helping students to understand professional science. This paper reviews largely independent lines of research into students' beliefs about the nature of science and their practices of inquiry to argue that students' inquiry is guided by practical epistemologies that are in need of study. An approach to studying practical epistemologies is proposed that has the potential to produce a better psychological theory of epistemological development, as well as to realize goals of a science education that develops scientifically informed citizens. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The first is error of approximation which involves the fit of the model, with optimally chosen but unknown parameter values, to the population covariance matrix. The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of "close fit" of a model is suggested.},

In Part II of the paper, researchers will learn how to use the Facets (Linacre, 2001) computer program to study five effects: leniency/severity, central tendency, randomness, halo, and differential leniency/severity. As we introduce each effect, we operationally define it within the context of a MFRM approach, specify the particular measurement model(s) needed to detect it, identify group- and individual-level statistical indicators of the effect, and show output from a Facets analysis, pinpointing the various indicators and explaining how to interpret each one. At the close of the paper, we describe other statistical procedures that have been used to detect and measure rater effects to help researchers become aware of important and influential literature on the topic and to gain an appreciation for the diversity of psychometric perspectives that researchers bring to bear on their work. Finally, we consider future directions for research in the detection and measurement of rater effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {We examine the process of writing hypertexts by learners and its impact on the acquisition of knowledge. Our main research question is how students deal with the multi-linear structure of hypertexts in a way that promotes learning. We present a study in which students were asked to construct a hypertext document by linking prepared nodes in two subsequent sessions. One group of students had to change the anticipated audience perspective between the two sessions, the other group had to consider one single perspective in both ses- sions. Cognitive processes were investigated using a computer-based assess- ment system (CEKOS). The resulting hypertexts were analyzed with regard to the link structure of the documents. Learning effects were measured with five knowledge tests. The results confirm that considering multiple audience per- spectives is an appropriate instruction to deal with the nonlinear structure of hypertexts in a way that promotes knowledge acquisition.},

Results showed that students' epistemic cognition was represented by one dimension concerning the certainty and simplicity of knowledge and three dimensions concerning the justification for knowing by different sources. Moreover, components of a mechanism of change, in particular epistemic doubt and resolution strategies, were identified in the think-aloud protocols. Finally, these mechanism of change components seemed to operate within distinct dimensions of epistemic cognition. Three case studies were used to elaborate on and illustrate how epistemic cognition may be differently involved in the reading of multiple conflicting documents over the course of reading. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement, but this impact can be either positive or negative. Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.

abstract = {The study investigates whether the strategy of translating an interview procedure into a standardized questionnaire proven and tested in the field of moral development by Rest (1979) can be transferred to other research areas of developmental psychology. To this end, a newly developed questionnaire for measuring the developmental level of epistemological beliefs (Fragebogen zur Erfassung des Entwicklungsniveaus epistemologischer {\{}{\"{U}}{\}}berzeugungen - FREE) is presented that is based on similar construction principles as the Defining Issues Test (DIT). The reliability and validity of this questionnaire are tested. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses demonstrate that the FREE adequately reflects effects of age and education on the development of epistemological beliefs. Furthermore, a substantive correlation between questionnaire and interview data was found. At the same time, however, questionnaire and interview procedures yielded quite different absolute estimates of individuals' competence level. Results are highly consistent with findings obtained in the field of moral development. The FREE, thus, provides a viable alternative to interview procedures for measuring the developmental level of epistemological beliefs as far as the focus is on individual differences rather than individuals' absolute competence level.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAbstract in German$\backslash$n$\backslash$nZusammenfassung.

In Experiment 1, an epistemological questionnaire was administered to undergraduates. Factor analysis of the questionnaire resulted in 4 factors reflecting degrees of belief in innate ability, simple knowledge, quick learning, and certain knowledge. In Experiment 2, students read a passage about either the social sciences or the physical sciences, in which the concluding paragraph was removed. Then they rated their confidence in understanding the passage, wrote a conclusion, and completed a mastery test. Belief in quick learning predicted oversimplified conclusions, poor performance on the mastery test, and overconfidence in test performance. Belief in certain knowledge predicted inappro- priately absolute conclusions. This},

For 3 days, salivary cortisol levels were measured at the time of awakening and 15, 30, and 60 min thereafter. On the night before the 3rd day, Ss took 0.5 mg dexamethasone orally for testing glucocorticoid feedback inhibition. Burnout and perceived stress were measured by 3 different questionnaires. Perceived stress correlated with increases of cortisol levels during the 1st hr after awakening after dexamethasone pretreatment. In addition, Ss scoring high on burnout showed lower overall cortisol secretion on all sampling days, and a higher suppression of cortisol secretion after dexamethasone administration. In the subgroup of Ss with both high levels of perceived stress and of burnout, a lower overall cortisol secretion was observed on the 1st 2 days, with stronger increases during the 1st hr after awakening after dexamethasone suppression. This subgroup also showed the lowest self-esteem, the highest external locus of control, and the highest number of somatic complaints. These results demonstrate differential effects of burnout and perceived stress on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {The purpose of this two-part paper is to introduce researchers to the many-facet Rasch measurement (MFRM) approach for detecting and measuring rater effects. The researcher will learn how to use the Facets (Linacre, 2001) computer program to study five effects: leniency/severity, central tendency, randomness, halo, and differential leniency/severity. Part 1 of the paper provides critical background and context for studying MFRM. We present a catalog of rater effects, introducing effects that researchers have studied over the last three-quarters of a century in order to help readers gain a historical perspective on how those effects have been conceptualized. The second half of Part 1 provides conceptual and mathematical explanations of many-facet Rasch measurement, focusing on how researchers can use MFRM to study rater effects. First, we present the many-facet version of Andrich's (1978) rating scale model and identify questions about a rating operation that researchers can address using this model. We then introduce three hybrid MFRM models, explain the conceptual distinctions among them, describe how they differ from the rating scale model, and identify questions about a rating operation that researchers can address using these hybrid models.

abstract = {Background and Objective: For inferring a treatment effect from the difference between a treated and untreated group on a quantitative outcome measured before and after treatment, current methods are analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the outcome with the baseline as covariate, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of change from baseline. This article compares both methods on power and bias, for randomized and nonrandomized studies. Methods: The methods are compared by writing both as a regression model and as a repeated measures model, and are applied to a nonrandomized study of preventing depression. Results: In randomized studies both methods are unbiased, but ANCOVA has more power. If treatment assignment is based on the baseline, only ANCOVA is unbiased. In nonrandomized studies with preexisting groups differing at baseline, the two methods cannot both be unbiased, and may contradict each other. In the study of depression, ANCOVA suggests absence, but ANOVA of change suggests presence, of a treatment effect. The methods differ because ANCOVA assumes absence of a baseline difference. Conclusion: In randomized studies and studies with treatment assignment depending on the baseline, ANCOVA must be used. In nonrandomized studies of preexisting groups, ANOVA of change seems less biased than ANCOVA, but two control groups and two baseline measurements are recommended. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Palazzo2010,
abstract = {Submissions to an online homework tutor were analyzed to determine whether they were copied. The fraction of copied submissions increased rapidly over the semester, as each weekly deadline approached and for problems later in each assignment. The majority of students, who copied less than 10{\%} of their problems, worked steadily over the three days prior to the deadline, whereas repetitive copiers those who copied 30{\%} of their submitted problems exerted little effort early. Importantly, copying homework problems that require an analytic answer correlates with a 2 decline over the semester in relative score for similar problems on exams but does not significantly correlate with the amount of conceptual learning as measured by pretesting and post-testing. An anonymous survey containing questions used in many previous studies of self-reported academic dishonesty showed 1/3 less copying than actually was detected. The observed patterns of copying, free response questions on the survey, and interview data suggest that time pressure on students who do not start their homework in a timely fashion is the proximate cause of copying. Several measures of initial ability in math or physics correlated with copying weakly or not at all. Changes in course format and instructional practices that previous self-reported academic dishonesty surveys and/or the observed copying patterns sug- gested would reduce copying have been accompanied by more than a factor of 4 reduction of copying from 11{\%} of all electronic problems to less than 3{\%}. As expected since repetitive copiers have approximately three times the chance of failing, this was accompanied by a reduction in the overall course failure rate. Survey results indicate that students copy almost twice as much written homework as online homework and show that students nationally admit to more academic dishonesty than MIT students.},

Accordingly, research guided by self-determination theory has focused on the social-contextual conditions that facilitate versus forestall the natural processes of self-motivation and healthy psychological development. Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs--competence, autonomy, and relatedness--which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.},

In this paper, we demonstrate the principles and application of multilevel factor analysis using a dataset from $\backslash$nhomework research (1712 students in 98 classes). As expected, the three factors under investigation (homework quality, teachers' $\backslash$nhomework control, and effective use of learning time in French lessons) were empirically distinguishable at both the student and the $\backslash$nclass level.

abstract = {Recently graduated university students from all Australian Universities rate their overall departmental and university experiences (DUEs), and their responses (N = 44,932, 41 institutions) are used by the government to benchmark departments and universities. We evaluate this DUE strategy of rating overall departments and universities rather than individual teachers, and we juxtapose it with the traditional use of student ratings to evaluate individual teachers (SETs). Multilevel analyses of DUE overall ratings were not able to discriminate well between universities or departments-few universities or departments differed significantly from the grand mean. Although the a priori 5-factor structure for this DUE instrument was reasonably well-defined at the individual student level, none of the 5 factors separately or in combination discriminated well between departments or universities. In contrast to this pattern of results, we review studies showing that SETs do reliably differentiate between teachers and are valid in relation to many criteria of effective teaching. However, casual reviews of these research literatures should not use this support for SETs to justify the use of DUE-type strategies. We conclude that DUE-type ratings should be used with great caution, if at all, and should not be seen as an alternative to SETs.},

abstract = {Prior research has shown that the agreement between teacher and student ratings of instructional quality is, at best, moderate, and the associations between measures of instructional quality and outcomes such as standardized achievement are typically small and somewhat mixed across both perspectives. One explanation for these low-to-moderate associations is the assumption that teacher and student ratings are not perfectly stable over time. By using a manifest-latent state-trait model, the present study investigated the following topics in a sample of 5th-grade students (74 classes) from vocational track schools: (a) the time consistency of teacher and student instructional quality ratings in math lessons over multiple measurement time points; (b) the agreement among teachers and students for time consistent rating components and single time point ratings; and (c) the predictive power of consistent rating components and single time point ratings with regard to a standardized math achievement test, and math self-concept. Results of multilevel factor analyses with 3 measurement time points over a period of 3 months showed a moderate-to-high time consistency for both teacher and student ratings. Furthermore, the agreement among teacher and student ratings regarding classroom management and goal clarity was higher for the consistent rating components than for ratings at single measurement time points, whereas this pattern was not found for support of autonomy. Finally, student consistent rating components predicted students' pretest adjusted math achievement and self-concept. The effect sizes for ratings at single measurement time points varied within quality dimensions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets. It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer science and, in particular, machine learning. The field encompasses many methods such as the lasso and sparse regression, classification and regression trees, and boosting and support vector machines. With the explosion of “Big Data” problems, statistical learning has be- come a very hot field in many scientific areas as well as marketing, finance, and other business disciplines. People with statistical learning skills are in high demand. One of the first books in this area—The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman)—was published in 2001, with a second edition in 2009. ESL has become a popular text not only in statis- tics but also in related fields. One of the reasons for ESL's popularity is its relatively accessible style. But ESL is intended for individuals with ad- vanced training in the mathematical sciences. An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) arose from the perceived need for a broader and less tech- nical treatment of these topics. In this new book, we cover many of the same topics as ESL, but we concentrate more on the applications of the methods and less on the mathematical details. We have created labs illus- trating how to implement each of the statistical learning methods using the popular statistical software package R. These labs provide the reader with valuable hands-on experience. This book is appropriate for advanced undergraduates or master's stu- dents in statistics or related quantitative fields or for individuals in other disciplines who wish to use statistical learning tools to analyze their data. It can be used as a textbook for a course spanning one or two semesters. We would like to thank several readers for valuable comments on prelim- inary drafts of this book: Pallavi Basu, Alexandra Chouldechova, Patrick Danaher, Will Fithian, Luella Fu, Sam Gross, Max Grazier G'Sell, Court- ney Paulson, Xinghao Qiao, Elisa Sheng, Noah Simon, Kean Ming Tan, and Xin Lu Tan.},

abstract = {Multilevel structural equation modeling (multilevel SEM) has become an established method to analyze multilevel multivariate data. The first useful estimation method was the pseudobalanced method. This method is approximate because it assumes that all groups have the same size, and ignores unbalance when it exists. In addition, full infor-mation maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is now available, which is often combined with robust chi-squares and standard errors to accommodate unmodeled heterogeneity (MLR). In addition, diago-nally weighted least squares (DWLS) methods have become available as estimation methods. This article compares the pseudobalanced estimation method, ML(R), and two DWLS methods by simulating a multilevel factor model with unbalanced data.The simulations included different sample sizes at the individual and group levels and differ-ent intraclass correlation (ICC). The within-group part of the model posed no problems. In the between part of the model, the different ICC sizes had no effect. There is a clear interaction effect between number of groups and estimation method. ML reaches unbiasedness fastest, then the two DWLS methods, then MLR, and then the pseudo-balanced method (which needs more than 200 groups). We conclude that both ML(R) and DWLS are genuine improvements on the pseudo-balanced approximation. With small sample sizes, the robust methods are not recommended.},

@article{Meuleman2009,
abstract = {Recently, there has been growing scientific interest for cross-national survey research. Various scholars have used multilevel techniques to link individual characteristics to aspects of the na-tional context. At first sight, multilevel SEM seems to be a promising tool for this purpose, as it integrates multilevel modeling within a latent variable framework. However, due to the fact that the number of countries in most international surveys does not exceed 30, the application of multilevel SEM in cross-national research is problematic. Taking European Social Survey (ESS) data as a point of departure, this paper uses Monte Carlo studies to assess the estimation accuracy of multilevel SEM with small group sample sizes. The results indicate that a group sample size of 20 – a situation common in cross-national research – does not guarantee accurate estimation at all. Unacceptable amounts of parameter and stan-dard error bias are present for the between-level estimates. Unless the standardized effect is very large (0.75), statistical power for detecting a significant between-level structural effect is seriously lacking. Required group sample sizes depend strongly on the specific interests of the researcher, the expected effect sizes and the complexity of the model. If the between-level model is relatively simple and one is merely interested in the between-level factor structure, a group sample size of 40 could be sufficient. To detect large ({\textgreater}0.50) structural effects at the between level, at least 60 groups are required. To have an acceptable probability of detecting smaller effects, more than 100 groups are needed. These guidelines are shown to be quite robust for varying cluster sizes and intra-class correlations (ICCs).},

Semi-structured interviews, observations and reflective journals were used to document the changes experienced by participants as they went through their two placements during their one-year teacher education course. The data indicated that when the mentoring relationships were positive and expectations were met, preservice teachers felt more confident as a teacher. However, for some participants, who experienced a partially negative mentoring relationship, their confidence declined and they felt they did not improve. Implications for practice are discussed.},

We hypothesized that several factors-including stable personality characteristics such as gender and conscientiousness, students' domain-specific homework motivation, and characteristics of homework assignments-have concomitant effects on student homework effort. The sample consisted of 511 students in Grades 8 and 9. Across all six school subjects, multilevel modelling showed that students' homework motivation and homework effort varied primarily as a function of their shared perceptions of homework quality and control (classroom level) and of their conscientiousness, individual perception of homework quality, and expectancy and value beliefs (student level). Domain-specific patterns were found for student gender in line with gender stereotypes. Cognitive ability, family background, and parental homework help or control were only loosely associated with homework motivation and homework effort. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Students' responses to the Students' Evaluation of Education Quality (SEEQ) survey were collected in 4,471 graduate and undergraduate courses, and these courses were separated into groups representing diverse academic disciplines and settings. Separate factor analyses of 6 groups of courses each clearly identified the evaluation factors that SEEQ was designed to measure, demonstrating the replicability and generality of the factors. The SEEQ factors were then correlated with a set of 16 student/course/instructor characteristics (e.g., class size, expected grades, teacher rank) in each group of courses. These correlations were typically small, and proportion of variance in the ratings that could be predicted by the combined set of characteristics (based on stepwise multiple regression) varied between .08 and .20 in the 6 groups of courses. Most of the predictable variance in each group of courses could be explained by the same 4 characteristics; more favorable ratings were associated with higher prior subject interest, higher expected grades, higher levels of workload/difficulty, and a higher percentage of students taking a course for general interest. Discussion indicates that the interpretation of these effects as a bias to student ratings is unwarranted, and alternative approaches are presented.

The instructional design in this study distinguished three different types of discussions-framing, conceptual, and application-based on their sequential position, their purpose, the instructional task, and the associated assessment methods. Data included transcripts from nine videotaped class sessions from a US seventh-grade mathematics classroom during a unit on surface area and volume. The findings showed differences in the types of discourse interactions among the three types of discussions. By understanding the relationship between the instructional design and the discourse interactions associated with each discussion type, mathematics teachers may find opportunities to plan classroom discussions with higher quality interactions. In addition, teacher educators and mentor teachers can use the findings from this study to provide explicit assistance and feedback to prospective and newly inducted teachers who want to incorporate classroom discussion into their instructional units. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Individual raters vary the severity of their ratings in a manner dependent upon a wide array of factors. Most efforts intended to secure reliable and valid ratings across judges assume that the goal is to obtain identical ratings from different judges for the same performance. In contrast to these approaches, probabilistic conjoint measurement facilitates observation and calibration of differences in judge severity, making it possible to account for these differences in the interpretation of the assigned ratings. This chapter addresses issues in the application of Facets analyses to writing assessment, aesthetic judgment, and the evaluation of public speaking ability.},

The purpose of this methodological/ substantive study is to apply a multiple-level growth modeling approach to the long-term stability of students' evaluations of teaching effectiveness (SETs). For a diverse cohort of 195 teachers who were evaluated continuously over 13 years (6,024 classes, an average of 30.9 classes per teacher), there was little evidence that teachers became either more or less effective with added experience. This stability of SETs generalized reasonably well over undergraduate- and graduate-level courses, early career teachers, and teachers who differed substantially in terms of their teaching effectiveness overall. Whereas there were substantial individual differences between teachers in terms of their teaching effectiveness, these individual differences were also highly stable over time. Although highly supportive of the use of SETs for many purposes, the results provide a serious challenge for existing programs that assume that SET feedback alone is sufficient to improve teaching effectiveness.},

Although many stud- ies have examined the properties of GFI as indicators of overall model fit for sin- gle-group data, there have been none to date that examine howGFIs change when be- tween-group constraints are added to a measurement model. The lack of a consensus about what constitutes significant GFI differences places limits on measurement invariance testing. We examine 20 GFIs based on the minimum fit function. A simulation under the two-group situation was used to examine changes in the GFIs (∆GFIs) when invariance constraints were added. Based on the results, we recommend using ∆comparative fit index,∆Gammahat, and∆McDonald's Noncentrality Index to eval- uate measurement invariance. These three ∆GFIs are independent of both model complexity and sample size, and are not correlated with the overall fit measures.We propose critical values of these ∆GFIs that indicate measurement invariance.

abstract = {Since the beginning of the century, feedback interventions (FIs) produced negative--but largely ignored--effects on performance. A meta-analysis (607 effect sizes; 23,663 observations) suggests that FIs improved performance on average ( d = .41) but that over one-third of the FIs decreased performance. This finding cannot be explained by sampling error, feedback sign, or existing theories. The authors proposed a preliminary FI theory (FIT) and tested it with moderator analyses. The central assumption of FIT is that FIs change the locus of attention among 3 general and hierarchically organized levels of control: task learning, task motivation, and meta-tasks (including self-related) processes. The results suggest that FI effectiveness decreases as attention moves up the hierarchy closer to the self and away from the task. These findings are further moderated by task characteristics that are still poorly understood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {Background: Teaching is considered a highly stressful occupation. Burnout is a negative affective response occurring as a result of chronic work stress. While the early theories of burnout focused exclusively on work-related stressors, recent research adopts a more integrative approach where both environmental and individual factors are studied. Nevertheless, such studies are scarce with teacher samples. Aims: The present cross-sectional study sought to investigate the association between burnout, personality characteristics and job stressors in primary school teachers from Cyprus. The study also investigates the relative contribution of these variables on the three facets of burnout- emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment. Sample: A representative sample of 447 primary school teachers participated in the study. Method: Teachers completed measures of burnout, personality and job stressors along with demographic and professional data. Surveys were delivered by courier to schools, and were distributed at faculty meetings. Results: Results showed that both personality and work-related stressors were associated with burnout dimensions. Neuroticism was a common predictor of all dimensions of burnout although in personal accomplishment had a different direction. Managing student misbehaviour and time constraints were found to systematically predict dimensions of burnout Conclusions: Teachers' individual characteristics as well as job related stressors should be taken into consideration when studying the burnout phenomenon. The fact that each dimension of the syndrome is predicted by different variables should not remain unnoticed especially when designing and implementing intervention programmes to reduce burnout in teachers.

abstract = {Die Entwicklung fachspezifischer Interessen gilt als wesentliches Ziel schulischer Bildung. So stellt sich auch die Frage, wie Unterricht gestalten werden kann, um Lernende in ihrer Interessenentwicklung optimal zu unterstutzen. Dieser Frage widmet sich das vorliegende Buch ausgehend von der Person-Gegenstands-Theorie des Interesses und des Vier-Phasen-Modells der Interessenentwicklung. Im Zentrum steht das Konzept des situationalen Interesses, das hoch relevant, aber gleichzeitig empirisch wenig erforscht ist. Der theoretische Teil umfasst die Systematisierung von Bedingungen des situationalen Interesses aus motivations- und unterrichtpsychologischer Sicht. Daran anknupfend werden Befunde einer quantitativen Studie mit 951 Schulerinnen und Schulern im Mathematikunterricht vorgestellt. Anhand von Mehrebenen-Mediationsanalysen wird das funktionale Zusammenspiel motivational-affektiver, kognitiver und instruktionaler Prozessmerkmale sowie ihr Zusammenhang mit dem situationalen Interesse untersucht. Die Befunde ermoglichen methodische und inhaltliche Schlussfolgerungen bezuglich der Erforschung des situationalen Interesses im Unterricht und eroffnen daruber hinaus vielfaltige Anregungen fur die padagogische Praxis.},

Students were surveyed in school regarding their cheating behaviors in math, and the motivational goal structures perceived in their math classrooms. Surveys were completed twice during the eighth grade (during middle school) and once at the end of the ninth grade (at the end of the first year in high school). Results indicated that self-reported cheating did not change in the year prior to the high school transition, but that reported cheating increased after the transition. Additional analyses indicated that across the high school transition, self-reported cheating in math increased for students who moved from high mastery to low mastery-oriented classes after the transition, and for students who moved from low performance to high performance-oriented classes; in contrast, self-reported cheating decreased for students who moved from low to high mastery-oriented math classrooms. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Previous research was used to derive higher-order models positing 1, 2, 3, and 4 higher-order factors. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of responses of SEEQ supported the 9 1st-order factors that SEEQ is designed to measure and the model with 4 2nd-order factors. For even the model with 4 higher-order factors, much of the true score variance in 1st-order factors was not explained by the higher-order factors. The study demonstrates that the SEEQ responses cannot be adequately explained by one or even a few summary scores and illustrates the application of hierarchical CFA.},

Pintrich, 1997) suggests that each of the primary models posit developmental trajectories that parallel one another. Regardless of the number of stages, positions, or perspectives, the sequence invariably suggests movement from a dualistic, objectivist view of knowledge to a more subjective, relativistic stance and ultimately to a contextual, constructivist perspective of knowing. In this chapter on epistemological thinking---and why it matters---the present authors identify the developmental tasks inherent in the growth of epistemological understanding. They suggest that it is this coordination of the subjective and objective dimensions of knowing that is the essence of epistemological development and describe their research in measuring the progression of this cognitive process from childhood to adulthood. Their work is an attempt to clarify and simplify our understanding of epistemological development and to situate it within our knowledge about cognitive development.

abstract = {Over the past three decades, research into the developmental course by means of which persons come to an increasingly mature conception of the knowing process has yielded an highly defracted picture. Despite some concert of opinion about the general bill of particulars, what remains deeply problematic is the increasingly radical disagreement that has arisen regarding the ages at which major milestones in the course of epistemic development are said to be reached. As a way of making some sense of these competing claims, it is argued that the emerging insight that knowledge is ineluctably shaped by those doing the knowing (i.e., that there is an unavoidable "world-to-mind direction of fit" (J.R. Searle, Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1983) between things in the world and the manner of their understanding) does not arrive in a single piece. Instead, as the data presented here help to illustrate, an appreciation of the constructed character of knowledge more commonly arrives piecemeal and at different ontogenetic moments, the times of which are governed by the place that different objects of knowledge occupy along an envisioned continuum of diverse epistemic contents. On this account, not all "facts of the matter" are ordinarily seen to occupy the same epistemic footing. Rather, some so-called facts are commonly understood to be of an "institutional" sort, where "representational" diversity is early expected and widely tolerated. By contrast, other objects of knowledge are imagined to be more like "brute" facts that, on some less mature readings, fully escape the clutches of subjective opinion. Viewed against the backcloth of this proposed continuum, a developmental sequence hypothesized according to which growing persons first come to view "institutional" facts as humanly constructed before subsequently coming to a similar view about presumptively "brute" facts. To test this hypothesis, 242 young persons were administered a paper and pencil measure of epistemic reasoning (the EDQ). Results strongly support the hypothesis that respondents understood the interpretive nature of beliefs about "institutional" facts at an earlier age than so-called "brute" facts. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Determining sample size requirements for structural equation modeling (SEM) is a challenge often faced by investigators, peer reviewers, and grant writers. Recent years have seen a large increase in SEMs in the behavioral science literature, but consideration of sample size requirements for applied SEMs often relies on outdated rules-of-thumb. This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety. Results revealed a range of sample size requirements (i.e., from 30 to 460 cases), meaningful patterns of association between parameters and sample size, and highlight the limitations of commonly cited rules-of-thumb. The broad "lessons learned" for determining SEM sample size requirements are discussed.},

This fact and the finding that test length is related to reliability may cause significant misinterpretations of measures when alpha is used as evidence that a measure is unidimensional. For multidimensional measures, use of alpha as the basis for corrections for attenuation causes overestimates of true correlation. Satisfactory levels of alpha depend on test use and interpretation. Even relatively low (e.g., .50) levels of criterion reliability do not seriously attenuate validity coefficients. When reporting intercorrelations among measures that should be discriminable, it is important to present observed correlations, appropriate measures of reliability, and correlations corrected for unreliability.},

abstract = {Abstract This exploratory case study reports on the findings of Persian teachers' motivation and use of Farsi-Web-based Learning Resources (FWBLRs) in classroom instruction. Data were inductively gathered from ten teachers' and five students' use experiences of {\{}FWBLRs{\}} in the context of a smart school in Tehran, Iran. Focus groups and face-to-face semi-structured interviews, repeated in several rounds, were used for data collection. Thematic analysis elaborate on the teachers' perceived pedagogical usability of FWBLRs. Five main motivations of pedagogical usability emerged from the findings: (a) desirability; (b) content accessibility; (c) student-centred teaching support; (d) multimedia interactivity; and (e) feasible classroom instruction via simulation. The study suggests that the effective use of Web-based Learning Resources (WBLRs) would require some considerations, including the use context and corresponding educational policies. This can be of value to the researchers in the field as well as stakeholders of WBLRs. In practice, this can support the development of effective and fun teaching–learning environments. },

This difference allowed a comparison between epistemological levels of students with different social experiences but with similar academic experiences.

Immediately after graduation participants filled in a questionnaire that assessed the self-concept (agency and communion), occupational self-efficacy, and career goal orientations regarding their occupational life(upward career vs. work-life balance vs. part-time employment). Two years later occupational strain was measured. Four years after graduation we again assessed occupational strain and occupational self-efficacy, and we additionally measured specific teacher-stress. Predictions were tested by means of a causal-analytical model; High instrumentality as well as high occupational self-efficacy led to reduced stress experiencing, whereas part-time employment goals and also work-life balance goals led to increased stress-experiencing. Gender had no influence. We discuss the usefulness of a self-regulatory approach that integrates the self-concept, self-efficacy beliefs and career goal orientations into the analysis of teacher stress.

abstract = {Effort on homework has a profound impact on student achievement. Researchers typically use an interindividual research design to explain homework effort. In this study with a total of 511 students from Grades 8 and 9, an interindividual perspective (focus on between-students differences) was combined with an intraindividual perspective (focus on within-student differences). Multilevel modeling showed that students' homework effort was a function of between-students differences in conscientiousness and within-student differences in perceived homework characteristics (subject-specific quality of tasks and homework control), perceived parental valuation of specific subjects, and homework motivation (subject-specific expectancy and value beliefs). Furthermore, a significant cross-level interaction indicated that perceived homework control by teachers had a stronger effect on students low in conscientiousness than on their more conscientious peers.

Some of the techniques are presented here for the first time. In contrast to methods that focus on relationships among variables, such as log-linear modeling, CFA allows researchers to evaluate differences and change at the level of individual cells in a table. Illustrated are ways to identify and test for cell configurations that are either consistent with or contrary to hypothesized patterns (the types and antitypes of CFA); control for potential covariates that might influence observed results; develop innovative prediction models; address questions of moderation and mediation; and analyze intensive longitudinal data.

abstract = {{\{}{\#}{\}}englisch{\{}{\#}{\}}The present contribution discusses the systems question, which has been a topic in pedagogics since the 18th century at the latest and which is still one of its major issues. Based on prior terminological considerations, the author first examines whether systems constructions have undergone a change from subject matter towards knowledge, from {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}world system{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} towards {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}knowledge system{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}. In a second step, he explains the pertinent opinions voiced by different systems critics, dividing them into two categories: subject-oriented and object-oriented arguments. Thirdly, these counterarguments are viewed from a critical-constructive perspective, leading to the conclusion that, although they have to be taken seriously, they do not exclude systems thinking. Based on these considerations, the author, in a final part, inquires into the question of what pedagogics as a system could and should achieve.

Cross-sectional studies, however, provide a weak basis for inferring the future ratings of less experienced teachers or the past ratings of more experienced teachers. Considered here are ratings of 6024 classes taught by a diverse cohort of 195 teachers representing 31 academic departments who were evaluated continuously over a 13-year period using the same multidimensional Students' Evaluations of Educational Quality instrument. For both undergraduate and graduate level courses, there were almost no changes over time for any of the nine content-specific dimensions, the overall course rating, or the overall instructor rating. The findings were consistent for teachers who had little, moderate, or substantial amounts of teaching experience at the start of the study. These results are important because this is apparently the only study to examine the stability of faculty ratings using a longitudinal design with a large and diverse group of teachers over such a long period of time.},

In considering how this body of literature can enhance  understanding of how students become masters of their learning processes, we will briefly  review how different theoretical frameworks have conceptualized the relation between  epistemic cognition, epistemic beliefs, calibration and metacognition, self-regulation, and  self-regulated learning. Implications for research include a more nuanced conceptualization of  epistemic beliefs and a theoretical integration of these constructs. Implications for practice  regard the reciprocal relations between teachers' knowledge, experience, epistemic cognition,  epistemic beliefs, and calibration and their effects on pedagogical practices. The role of  teachers' education and professional development is discussed.  },

The protagonists do not justify their views, and the vignettes do not contain enough information to resolve the issues. We asked our participants why the protagonists disagreed, which one was right, whether the dispute could be resolved, and if so how. Analysis of changes with age in their judgments as to the resolvability of the issues, and their reasons for believing one or another protagonist, revealed increasing awareness of the complexity of both the outer world of objective "reality" and the inner worlds of individual knowers, and a deeper understanding of the ways in which the two worlds intersect in the creation of knowledge. Issues of "fact" and "opinion" became less sharply differentiated as the act of knowing became less reactive and more constructive. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Worked examples research is a cognitive-experimental program that has relevance to classroom instruction and the broader educational research community. A framework for organizing the findings of this research is proposed, leading to instructional design principles. For instance, one instructional design principle suggests that effective examples have highly integrated components. They employ multiple modalities in presentation and emphasize conceptual structure by labeling or segmenting. At the lesson level, effective instruction employs multiple examples for each conceptual problem type, varies example formats within problem type, and employs surface features to signal deep structure. Also, examples should be presented in close proximity to matched practice problems. Moreover, learners can be encouraged through direct training or by the structure of the worked example to actively self-explain examples. Worked examples are associated with early stages of skill development, but the design principles are relevant to constructivist research and teaching.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that sophisticated epistemological beliefs exert a positive influence on students' learning strategies and learning outcomes. This gives a clear educational relevance to studies on the development of methods for promoting a change in epistemological beliefs and making them more sophisticated. AIMS: To investigate the potential for influencing domain-specific epistemological beliefs through a short instructional intervention. SAMPLE: On the basis of their performance on a preliminary survey of epistemological beliefs, 58 students at a German university (87.7{\%} females) with a mean age of 21.86 years (SD=2.88) were selected. Half of them had more naive beliefs and the other half had more sophisticated ones. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one whose epistemological beliefs were challenged through refutational epistemological instruction or another receiving non-challenging informational instruction. The treatment effect was assessed by comparing pre- and post-instructional scores on two instruments tapping different layers of epistemological beliefs (DEBQ and CAEB). Data were subjected to factor analyses and analyses of variance. RESULTS: According to the CAEB, the naive group receiving the refutational epistemological instruction changed towards a more sophisticated view, whereas the sophisticated students receiving the informational instruction changed towards an unintended, more naive standpoint. According to the DEBQ, all research groups except the naive refutational group revealed changes towards a more naive view. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates the possibility of changing domain-specific epistemological beliefs through a short-term intervention. However, it questions the stability and elaborateness of domain-specific epistemological beliefs, particularly when domain knowledge is shallow.},

abstract = {{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}This practical introduction helps readers apply multilevel techniques to their research. Noted as an accessible introduction, the book also includes advanced extensions, making it useful as both an introduction and as a reference to students, researchers, and methodologists. Basic models and examples are discussed in non-technical terms with an emphasis on understanding the methodological and statistical issues involved in using these models. The estimation and interpretation of multilevel models is demonstrated using realistic examples from various disciplines. For example, readers will find data sets on stress in hospitals, GPA scores, survey responses, street safety, epilepsy, divorce, and sociometric scores, to name a few. The data sets are available on the website in SPSS, HLM, MLwiN, LISREL and/or Mplus files. Readers are introduced to both the multilevel regression model and multilevel structural models.{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}Highlights of the second edition include:{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}--Two new chapters one on multilevel models for ordinal and count data (Ch. 7) and another on multilevel survival analysis (Ch. 8).{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}-Thoroughly updated chapters on multilevel structural equation modeling that reflect the enormous technical progress of the last few years.{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}-The addition of some simpler examples to help the novice, whilst the more complex examples that combine more than one problem have been retained.{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}-A new section on multivariate meta-analysis (Ch. 11).{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}-Expanded discussions of covariance structures across time and analyzing longitudinal data where no trend is expected.{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}-Expanded chapter on the logistic model for dichotomous data and proportions with new estimation methods.{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}-An updated website at v ww.000hox.net/ with data sets for all the text examples and up-to-date screen shots and PowerPoint slides for instructors.{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}Ideal for introductory courses on multilevel modeling and/or ones that introduce this topic in some detail taught in a variety of disciplines including: psychology, education, sociology, the health sciences, and business, the advanced extensions also make this a favorite resource for researchers and methodologists in these disciplines.

The Special Issue starts with a theoretical paper. It is then followed by four empirical studies which deal with one or more of these questions. From all contributions it emerges that epistemic beliefs are situated within a metacognitive architecture of our mind. Moreover, all the empirical papers examine epistemic beliefs in relation to other constructs that include metacognitive aspects, mainly self-regulation in learning. We hope that the articles of this Special Issue will inspire future studies for a more indepth investigation into the complex but fascinating field of personal beliefs about knowledge and knowing.

abstract = {Changing jobs or professions, which is one reported behavioural outcome of teacher burnout (Lee and Asforth, 1990), is a logical method of escape. Unfortunately, large percentages of teachers who suffer burnout remain in their positions (Jackson et al., 1986; Watts and Short, 1990) and may negatively affect the educational process. If the potential negative effects of burnout are to be avoided, it is necessary to identify behaviours that may serve as precursors to burnout. A model is presented here that incorporates a direct comparison between an employee's capacity and job demands (Jaques, 1961). The behaviours resulting from these comparisons are unique and may serve as precursors to the more intense attitudinal and behavioural outcomes associated with burnout (Cherniss, 1980a, 1980b; Maslach and Jackson, 1981, 1986). In addition, each unique behaviour (Jaques, 1961) represents an opportunity to manage turnover better and to intervene in the burnout process.

Dies sei deshalb so, weil Prozesse des Zielsetzens (»goal setting«) und der Zielrealisierung (»goal striving«) jeweils anderen psychologischen Prinzipien unterliegen. Diese Einsicht blieb lange Zeit unber{\"{u}}cksichtigt, wahrscheinlich aus dem einfachen Grund, weil die Analyse des Zielsetzens anhand von Erwartungs-Wert-Modellen sehr erfolgreich war (Festinger, 1942; Atkinson, 1957) und so die ganze Aufmerksamkeit der Motivationspsychologie band. Erst mit dem Erwachen der Zielpsychologie (beginnend mit Klingers »current concerns«, 1977, und Wicklund und Gollwitzers »self-definitional goals«, 1982) und der Psychologie der Handlungskontrolle basierend auf Kuhls Analyse der Lage- vs. Handlungsorientierung, 1983; ▸ detaillierte Ausf{\"{u}}hrungen in Kap. 13) wurde den Prozessen und den mehr oder weniger erfolgreichen Strategien der Zielrealisierung die Aufmerksamkeit zu teil, die ihnen Kurt Lewin bereits in den 40er-Jahren zugedacht hatte (Oettingen {\&} Gollwitzer, 2001).

Our attention to teachers' mathematical conceptions focused on the development of PMTs' problem-solving competences. Our attention to teachers' meta-mathematical and pedagogical conceptions focused on changes in teachers' views concerning the level of interest and level of difficulty of the mathematical tasks. We differentiated between the systematic and craft modes of professional development integrated in the course. Systematic mode involved problem-solving sessions and reflective discussions on collective solution spaces. Craft mode involved interviewing school students.

Zus{\"{a}}tzlich wurden Eingangsmerkmale der Studierenden als Pr{\"{a}}diktoren zur Erkl{\"{a}}rung interindividueller Unterschiede einbezogen.

(DIPF/Orig.).;;;At the beginning of their studies, students in teacher training are often strongly interested in pedagogical contents. However, whether this strong interest remains stable throughout the course of studies has as yet hardly been examined empirically. On the basis of a sample of N = 1169 students enrolled in teacher training, the present study investigates how the interest in educational-scientific contents develops over a period of four semesters. In addition, enrollment characteristics of students are included as predictors for the explanation of inter-individual differences. A key result of latent growth curve models is that, on average, the interest in educational sciences remains stable over time, however, significant variance is revealed in the change value. This can be explained by the certainty of the choice of studies and the type of teaching post aimed at, namely, it can be shown that students who are to a high degree sure that they made the right choice and students choosing an academic track program tend to build up interest.

abstract = {Background: In recent decades, two lines of research, phenomenographic and meta-cognitive, have examined students' approaches and epistemological beliefs about learning. To date there has been very little research describing the change in epistemological beliefs in European secondary students, or analysing interrelationships between epistemological beliefs and approaches in order to explain their influence on academic performance. Aims: The first aim of this investigation is to analyse the change in epistemological beliefs and learning approaches in secondary students as they progress through their studies. The second aim is to examine the effects of epistemological beliefs on learning approaches, and learning approaches on academic performance. Sample: About 1,600 Spanish students, boys and girls, from several secondary schools took part in the study. They were between 12 and 20 years old and their average age was 14.79 years. Methods: Measures of epistemological beliefs (EQ: Epistemological Questionnaire), learning approaches (LPQ: Learning Process Questionnaire), and academic performance were obtained. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the dimensionality of the EQ and LPQ questionnaires. In order to achieve our two aims, different statistical techniques were used: MANOVA and ANOVA for our first aim, and structural equation modelling for our second aim. Results: Throughout secondary education epistemological beliefs undergo change, becoming more realistic and complex, and deep-approach scores decline significantly. It was shown that, as predicted, epistemological beliefs influenced academic achievement directly, and also indirectly via students' learning approaches. Conclusions: Our findings point to two conclusions. First, epistemological beliefs and learning approaches change as pupils advance in their studies. Second, the relationship between epistemological beliefs and academic achievement is mediated by approaches to learning.

However, there is evidence that not all teachers deal successfully with the demands of the transition resulting in high levels of occupational stress and burnout symptoms. The present study investigates first the development of emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction in the first two years of beginning teachers. Second, we investigate the effects of personality traits, previous educational experiences, pedagogical content knowledge, knowledge about classroom behavior and self-regulatory skills on student teachers emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. The data consists of more than 500 beginning teachers in their practical phase of teacher education, who were examined in a multi-cohort longitudinal study. The results suggest that emotional exhaustion increases significantly in the first year of teaching practice, while it remains stable in the second year Compared to a sample of experienced teachers, beginning teachers report similar emotional exhaustion but higher job satisfaction. Personality traits as well as aspects of professional knowledge and educational experience explained interindividual differences in the development of exhaustion and satisfaction over one year. The implications of the present results for the professional development of teachers are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a frequently used multivariate analysis technique in statistics. Jennrich and Sampson (1966) solved a significant EFA factor loading matrix rotation problem by deriving the direct Quartimin rotation. Jennrich was also the first to develop standard errors for rotated solutions, although these have still not made their way into most statistical software programs. This is perhaps because Jennrich's achievements were partly overshadowed by the subsequent development of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by J{\"{o}}reskog (1969). The strict requirement of zero cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model modification to find a well-fitting model. In such cases, searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore, misspecification of zero loadings usually leads to distorted factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations. This article describes an EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives access to all the usual SEM parameters and the loading rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed. Examples of ESEM models include multiple-group EFA with measurement and structural invariance testing, test–retest (longitudinal) EFA, EFA with covariates and direct effects, and EFA with correlated residuals. Testing strategies with sequences of EFA and CFA models are discussed. Simulated and real data are used to illustrate the points.},

Reliability is good when based upon 10 to 15 or more student response; The ratings have successfully been validated against the retrospective ratings of former students, student learning as measured by objective examination, affective course consequences, and staff self evaluations of their own teaching effectiveness. Suspected sources of bias to the ratings have been shown to have little impact. Feedback from student ratings, particularly when coupled with a candid discussion with an external consultant, produced improvement in both subsequent ratings and student learning.},

@article{StrohmKitchener2002,
abstract = {Claims have been made that similar patterns in the development of folk epistemology occur in children, adolescents, and college students. Some researchers claim that children hold absolutistic assumptions about knowledge that evolve into a kind of relativistic framework where personal interpretation is primary, and last into a rationalistic epistemology. Others suggest the same developmental sequence begins in early adolescence or during the college years. The question addressed in this article is how to make sense of these seemingly discrepant claims and the data supporting them. After initially reviewing the alternative models, Fischer's (Psychol. Rev. 87 (1980) 477-531) skill theory is suggested as a framework for understanding the apparent discrepancies that considers both measurement and time of development issues. Fischer and his colleagues distinguish between "functional level" and "optimal level". Functional level is the level at which most people operate without contextual support or practice. It marks the lower end of the development range. He contrasts this to "optimal level" which marks the upper limit of the person's information processing activity. Performance on epistemological tasks may vary between these two levels. Functional and optimal level data from the reflective judgment model (Developing Reflective Judgment: Understanding and Promoting Intellectual Growth and Critical Thinking in Adolescents and Adults, Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, 1994) are used to illustrate the different levels of folk epistemology expressed under these two conditions and different ages at which they appear. The importance of using consistent, structural descriptions of epistemological levels across different models is emphasized for comparison purposes and, again, skill theory is suggested as one alternative framework for describing differences in structure across levels and reinterpreting the data on epistemological assumptions in children, adolescents, and college students. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this report we evaluate the short screening scale in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a population‐based survey of US household and group quarter residents. DSM‐IV PTSD was assessed via symptom questions in the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule‐DSM‐IV (AUDADIS‐IV) version. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and percent correctly classified were calculated, using the interview‐based diagnosis as the standard. Replicating findings from the initial report, a score of four or more on the short screening scale identifies cases of PTSD with sensitivity of 78{\%}, specificity of 97{\%}, positive predictive value of 75{\%}, and negative predictive value of 98{\%}. The percentage of correctly classified respondents was 96{\%}. The findings support the utility of the seven‐item scale for screening PTSD in clinical and general population samples.},

abstract = {{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}The majority of data sets collected by researchers in all disciplines are multivariate, meaning that several measurements, observations, or recordings are taken on each of the units in the data set. These units might be human subjects, archaeological artifacts, countries, or a vast variety of other things. In a few cases, it may be sensible to isolate each variable and study it separately, but in most instances all the variables need to be examined simultaneously in order to fully grasp the structure and key features of the data. For this purpose, one or another method of multivariate analysis might be helpful, and it is with such methods that this book is largely concerned. Multivariate analysis includes methods both for describing and exploring such data and for making formal inferences about them. The aim of all the techniques is, in general sense, to display or extract the signal in the data in the presence of noise and to find out what the data show us in the midst of their apparent chaos. An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R explores the correct application of these methods so as to extract as much information as possible from the data at hand, particularly as some type of graphical representation, via the R software. Throughout the book, the authors give many examples of R code used to apply the multivariate techniques to multivariate data.{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}--Publisher's description.},

abstract = {In der Arbeit wurde untersucht, ob das p{\"{a}}dagogisch-psychologische Wissen (PPK) von angehenden Lehrkr{\"{a}}ften bedeutsam ist f{\"{u}}r deren sp{\"{a}}teren Unterrichtserfolg. PPK, definiert als Wissen, das zur Gestaltung des Unterrichts in verschiedenen F{\"{a}}chern notwendig ist, wurde anhand eines Testinstruments mit 39 Items erfasst [...]. 181 Lehramtskandidatinnen und -kandidaten wurden w{\"{a}}hrend des Referendariats getestet, und deren 7 968 Sch{\"{u}}lerinnen und Sch{\"{u}}ler bearbeiteten zwei Jahre sp{\"{a}}ter in einer Follow-up-Erhebung Frageb{\"{o}}gen zur Unterrichtsqualit{\"{a}}t. Mithilfe von Mehrebenen-Strukturgleichungsmodellen wurde gezeigt, dass PPK der angehenden Lehrkr{\"{a}}fte statistisch signifikant die sp{\"{a}}tere Effizienz der Klassenf{\"{u}}hrung sowie die konstruktive Lernunterst{\"{u}}tzung vorhersagte. F{\"{u}}r das Potenzial zur kognitiven Aktivierung im Unterricht erwies sich PPK hingegen als nicht bedeutsam. (DIPF/Orig.).;;;The authors examine whether the pedagogical-psychological knowledge (PPK) of future teachers is of significance to the later successfulness of their teaching. PKK, defined as knowledge required for the design of lessons in different subjects, was surveyed by applying a test instrument containing 39 items [...]. 181 candidates for the teaching profession were tested during their internship and, in a follow-up survey carried out two years later, their 7968 students answered questionnaires on the quality of their lessons. By means of multilevel structural-equation-modeling it could be shown that the PPK of future teachers allowed for a statistically significant prediction of the later efficiency of their classroom management and of the constructive learning support. With regard to the potential for cognitive activation during lessons, however, PPK did not prove significant. (DIPF/Orig.).},

abstract = {In nonrandomized trials, patients are not randomly assigned to treatment groups with equal probability. Instead, the probability of assignment varies from patient to patient depending on patients baseline covariates. This often results in a non-comparable treatment groups due to treatment imbalance. As a result, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that the method of propensity score analysis be employed to overcome this problem. In this note, a formula for sample size calculation is developed based on a proposed weighted Mantel-Haenszel test on the strata defined by the propensity score analysis. It was shown that the sample size formula derived by Nam (1998) based on the test statistic proposed by Gart (1985) is a special case of the sample size formula derived in this note.},

abstract = {In many observational studies, analysts estimate treatment effects using propensity scores, e.g. by matching or sub-classifying on the scores. When some values of the covariates are missing, analysts can use multiple imputation to fill in the missing data, estimate propensity scores based on the m completed datasets, and use the propensity scores to estimate treatment effects. We compare two approaches to implement this process. In the first, the analyst estimates the treatment effect using propensity score matching within each completed data set, and averages the m treatment effect estimates. In the second approach, the analyst averages the m propensity scores for each record across the completed datasets, and performs propensity score matching with these averaged scores to estimate the treatment effect. We compare properties of both methods via simulation studies using artificial and real data. The simulations suggest that the second method has greater potential to produce substantial bias reductions than the first, particularly when the missing values are predictive of treatment assignment.},

Anforderungs- und subdisziplinbezogene Strukturannahmen werden mithilfe eines Testinstruments zur Erfassung p{\"{a}}dagogischen Wissens an einer Stichprobe von 802 angehenden Lehrern modelliert.

(DIPF/Orig.).;;;This contribution investigates which structural dimensions underlie future teachers' pedagogical knowledge. With the increasing orientation towards standards and competencies in teacher education future teachers are challenged by the task to acquire profession-related pedagogical knowledge. However, their opportunities to learn are predominantly structured by a system of scientific disciplines. Against this background, it is assumed that future teachers acquire knowledge within educational subdisciplines rather than being oriented towards professional tasks across educational subdisciplines. Assumptions on the structure of future teachers' knowledge oriented to discipline and profession are modelled with a standardized achievement test measuring pedagogical knowledge of future teachers. A sample of 802 future teachers is used. The results show that the pedagogical knowledge of future teachers can be structured around educational subdisciplines. However, the correspondent model is not superior to a model structuring the pedagogical knowledge around professional tasks. Implications for the educational component of teacher education are discussed. (DIPF/Orig.).},

The effects of combining BL with SRL on developing students' computing skills in applying database management system (DBMS) to solve authentic problems are encouraging. The students in the case of BL with SRL paid positive attention to this newer teaching method and had a statistically higher rate of passing a certification test than those in the traditional class.

abstract = {Theories of self-regulated learning assume that learners flexibly adapt their learning process to external task demands and that this is positively related to performance. In this study, university students (n = 119) solved three tasks that greatly differed in complexity. Their learning processes were captured in detail by task-specific questionnaires and computer-generated log files. Results indicate that students adapted almost all learning processes significantly to task complexity. For example, students accessed more hypertext pages for complex tasks than for simple tasks. However, this kind of adaptation was not consistently related to performance. For variables capturing learners' self-regulation, such as the number of accessed hypertext pages, more pronounced adaptation was significantly and positively related to performance even when learners' general processing depth was statistically controlled. Results were less consistent for variables capturing learners' self-monitoring, such as their judged task complexity. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Oliveira2012,
abstract = {This study explores how elementary teachers and students use hedges (tentative words such as maybe) and boosters (expressions of certainty such as clearly and obviously) during science inquiry discussions. Drawing upon semiotic theory, we examine explicit thematic patterns (semantic meaning relations among science concepts) as well as hidden social, nature of science (NOS), and epistemological meanings co-constructed and communicated by teachers and students. It was found that a kindergarten teacher's discussion was mostly unhedged and boosted (absolutely), with the use of hedges (may, might, could) limited to an unexpected encounter with an undeveloped egg toward the end of the lesson. In contrast, a fourth-grade teacher's discussion was predominantly hedged, with the use of boosters limited to isolated episodes concerning the nature of scientific inquiry and experimental variables. Unhedged and boosted communication led to the co-construction of an unproblematic or factual body of scientific knowledge (transitivity, circumstantial, and nominal meanings), whereas hedged communication produced a problematic or tentative body of scientific knowledge (logical and taxonomic meanings). It is emphasized that unproblematic knowledge communication may be paralleled by NOS miscommunication. We argue that teachers should be provided with professional development that can increase their awareness of the risk of NOS miscommunication. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{Estes2003,
abstract = {Epistemological beliefs about the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge are often assumed to be similar across different domains of knowledge. This assumption was tested by comparing beliefs about scientific research on psychological and biological development. Undergraduates from the United States and the United Kingdom responded to a set of epistemologically relevant statements about each field and then compared the two fields directly in terms of their confidence in the conclusions and advice of experts. On all measures, more negative beliefs were expressed about research on psychological development. Although U.S. students were more skeptical about both fields, U.S. and U.K. students displayed similar response patterns. To justify their skepticism toward scientific research as a valid source of knowledge about psychological development, students in both countries gave similar reasons (e.g., the difficulty in accurately measuring psychological variables). These results demonstrate that epistemological beliefs can differ substantially between two closely related fields. They also highlight issues that must be addressed to make education about the validity of research in developmental psychology more effective. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

This book fills a critical gap in our understanding of a long-neglected facet of the critical thinking process: reflective judgment. Drawing on extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal research, including their own ten-year study, Patricia M. King and Karen Strohm Kitchener detail the series of stages that lay the foundation for reflective thinking, and they trace the development of reflective judgment through adolescence and adulthood. King and Kitchener's new model of reflective judgment is designed to enhance both research and practice in the areas of critical thinking, intellectual development, and education. The authors examine key questions concerning reflective judgment: How do high school, college, and graduate students reason differently about ill-structured problems? Does students' reasoning improve with additional exposure to and involvement in higher education? Do adult learners differ from traditional-age students in their reflective thinking? How does the reasoning of adult college graduates differ from that of non-college-educated adults? The authors also describe the implications of the Reflective Judgment Model for working with students in the classroom and beyond - encouraging educators to think differently about interactions with their students and to create ways of more effectively promoting the ability to make reflective judgments.},

abstract = {Procrastination (pathologically postponing work on important tasks) is a clinically relevant disorder of self-control. Patients with this disorder do not complete personally relevant tasks in time or not at all, or only under extreme pressure. Common treatment approaches combine various elements from psycho-educative and cognitive-behavioral interventions. In contrast, we present an approach focusing mainly on restricting working time as a treatment method for procrastination. Patients are allowed to work only during certain time windows and only for a set amount of time. Only by increasing their working efficiency, i.e. by utilizing the previously allotted working time as efficiently as possible, they can earn more working time. Restricting the working time leads to a change of perspective from 'I have to study (continuously)' to 'I am allowed to study (right now)'. This short intervention of only 5 sessions can be delivered in a group setting or in an individual setting. Here, we will present its application within a group setting. An evaluation of restricting working time as a group intervention produced convincing effect sizes in the self-assessment instruments as well as with respect to daily study and working behavior assessed via an online working diary.

By building knowledge from information, data mining adds considerable value to the ever increasing stores of electronic data that abound today. In performing data mining many decisions need to be made regarding the choice of methodology, the choice of data, the choice of tools, and the choice of algorithms.Throughout this book the reader is introduced to the basic concepts and some of the more popular algorithms of data mining. With a focus on the hands-on end-to-end process for data mining, Williams guides the reader through various capabilities of the easy to use, free, and open source Rattle Data Mining Software built on the sophisticated R Statistical Software. The focus on doing data mining rather than just reading about data mining is refreshing.The book covers data understanding, data preparation, data refinement, model building, model evaluation, and practical deployment. The reader will learn to rapidly deliver a data mining project using software easily installed for free from the Internet. Coupling Rattle with R delivers a very sophisticated data mining environment with all the power, and more, of the many commercial offerings.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a study conducted among pre-service home economics teachers from the Faculty of Education of the University of Ljubljana with different levels of practical experience in teaching. The pre-service Home Economics teachers in the 3rd year of their studies had just completed their first class of teaching experience in contrast to the pre-service teachers from the 4th year of their faculty studies, who had conducted more teaching lessons. The results showed that the 4th-year pre-service teachers had fewer doubts and problems concerning the planning and conducting of a lesson. They also statistically significantly agreed that they are sufficiently prepared to teach than the 3rd-year pre-service teachers are. The results showed that the majority of the pre-service teachers agreed that the feedback from their colleagues was helpful for their professional development. The results suggest the importance of practical teaching experience in the context of professional development and the intention to continue a career in education. However, the results also revealed some critical points in the teacher's development of competency. The results suggest problems related to the application of theoretical knowledge on the children's development in practice and pro problems related to classroom management in specific situations.

Three types of investigations are identified: examinations of observed relationships between social experiences and belief understanding, attempts to facilitate the reasoning of children on the verge of belief understanding through experiences intended to compel children to face reasoning inconsistencies; and training studies demonstrating that children can be trained to understand belief over time through specific feedback experiences. A comparison of these studies reveals that experience is defined differently across them, resulting in varying and sometimes ambiguous implications for a theory–theory perspective on development.

The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is re- quired to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small},

abstract = {Background: There is burgeoning research within educational psychology on both epistemic cognition and multiple--documents literacy, as well as on relationships between the two constructs. Aim: To examine relationships between epistemic cognition concerning the justification of knowledge claims and sourcing and argumentation skills. Sample: Participants were 51 Norwegian undergraduates. Method: Three dimensions of justification were identified in think--aloud protocols based on students' reading of six documents presenting conflicting claims on the controversial scientific issue of cell phone radiation and health risks: justification by authority, personal justification and justification by multiple sources. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the unique predictability of these dimensions for essay performance after removing variance associated with prior knowledge about the topic of the documents. Results: After controlling for topic knowledge, justification by multiple sources uniquely predicted students' sourcing and argumentation in essays that they wrote after reading the documents, with students trying to justify knowledge claims by corroborating across several sources of information more likely to include explicit source citations, link sources and contents, and display better, more integrated argumentation in their essays. Conclusion: Findings are considered in the light of a theoretical framework for multiple--documents literacy adapted to the domain of science, and both theoretical and educational implications are discussed.

abstract = {This study explored the domain specificity of students' beliefs about academic knowledge in three related studies. Using a four-factor model as an initial framework, a series of domain-specific items about mathematics and history was developed. In Study I, these items were administered to 182 undergraduates, and the psychometric properties and underlying factor structure were examined via exploratory factor analysis. In Study II, the modified instrument, the Domain-Specific Beliefs Questionnaire (DSBQ), was administered to 633 students and a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted. A subsample of participants' responses on the DSBQ was also compared to responses on Schommer's epistemological questionnaire. Study III involved a second confirmatory factor analysis using data from a new sample (n = 523). Those data were examined for potential gender differences. Overall, the results of this investigation suggested that students possess certain domain-specific beliefs about knowledge in mathematics and history. Further, a significant moderate relationship between the DSBQ and Schommer's questionnaire provided some evidence of domain-generality in undergraduates' epistemological beliefs.},

One hundred and fifty-two university students completed three questionnaires that assessed their epistemological beliefs about mathematics (hardpure), the social sciences (also pure), and business (neither hard nor pure). Correlations indicated that students' epistemological beliefs were similar for mathematics and social sciences, as well as for mathematics and business. When the amount of academic experience was taken into account, some evidence of domain specificity was found. These results support Sternberg's caveat that the dichotomy of domain generality/ specificity is an assumption that should be questioned. We propose that future researchers should investigate the breadth of applicability of epistemological beliefs.},

From the larger sample, 78 students participated in a problem-solving session using a think aloud protocol. Results demonstrated that for self-reported metacognitive strategies, students profiled as both rational and empirical had the highest frequency of metacognitive strategy use compared to students profiled as empirical. Similarly, during problem solving, students profiled as both rational and empirical had the highest frequency of regulation of cognition compared to students profiled as empirical or rational. Finally, students profiled as both rational and empirical attained higher levels of problem-solving achievement compared to students profiled as empirical.

abstract = {The written instrumentation for measuring personal epistemology that currently has the most widespread use is M. Schommer's Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaire, which does not measure stages or positions of development, but utilizes a Likert-type scale to assess dimensions of epistemological beliefs. Among several recent attempts to refine this type of questionnaire for the assessment of epistemological beliefs, the present authors describe their development and validation of the Epistemic Belief Inventory, modeled on Schommer's questionnaire. Their report may be of particular use to those seeking to understand the construction of such instruments and who wish to compare existing instruments for research purposes. This chapter examines adults' beliefs about the nature and acquisition of knowledge, or epistemic beliefs, and reports on the ongoing validation of the Epistemic Beliefs Inventory (EBI). The EBI is compared to the Epistemological Questionnaire (EQ) developed by Schommer (1990). Findings are discussed with respect to implications for future instrument development.

Design: Study 1 examined associations between teacher self-efficacy and cardiac activation on a working day and Study 2 assessed the cortisol morning response in teachers with varying levels of teacher self-efficacy. Main outcome measures: Teacher self-efficacy was assessed by questionnaire. In Study 1 heart rate, heart rate variability, and locomotor activity were recorded by 22 hours ambulatory monitoring and subjective measures of stress and strain were obtained. Study 2 assessed the cortisol response to awakening to obtain a measure of HPA-axis activation and teachers filled in a questionnaire on physical complaints. Results and Conclusion: Study 1 found that self-efficacy proved protective for psychological well-being. Moreover, after controlling for locomotor activity, demographic, and lifestyle variables, self-efficacy was associated with elevated heart rate and attenuated heart rate variability during school and leisure time, respectively, but not during the night, thus questioning the health-implications of self-efficacy. Study 2 found that teachers high in self-efficacy exhibited an attenuated cortisol response to awakening and fewer cardiac complaints. The results of both studies are compatible with the view that teacher self-efficacy might act as a physiological toughening agent with possibly favorable health outcomes.

Subjects (N = 116) competed in a basketball free-throw shooting game, following which they completed the IMI. The LISREL VI computer program was employed to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis to assess the tenability of a five factor hierarchical model representing four first-order factors or dimensions and a second-order general factor representing intrinsic motivation. Indices of model acceptability tentatively suggest that the sport data adequately fit the hypothesized five factor hierarchical model. Alternative models were tested but did not result in significant improvements in the goodness-of-fit indices, suggesting the proposed model to be the most accurate of the models tested. Coefficient alphas for the four dimensions and the overall scale indicated adequate reliability. The results are discussed with regard to the importance of accurate assessment of psychological constructs and the use of linear structural equations in confirming the factor structures of measures.},

abstract = {This paper presents a discussion of the bandwidth-fidelity dilemma in personality measurement for personnel selection purposes. Should job applicants be assessed on fine-grained personality variables or on broader personality variables, such as the Big Five dimensions of personality? Most human resources practitioners and researchers appear to assume that more specific and narrow measures of personality traits result in better and more fine-grained understanding of the person, and therefore ought to be preferred over global measures. We review evidence that when the criterion of interest is job performance, broader personality measures may be preferable over narrowly focused ones. It appears that the alleged advantages of narrowly defined traits and narrowly constructed measures are mainly due to erroneous conventional beliefs predicated upon statistical artifacts.

abstract = {Over the previous decade, higher education in Slovenia and Serbia has undergone considerable reforms, influenced by the Bologna process and its agenda of competence and learning outcomes. In the context of these reforms, the aim of this research is to consider the question of the relationship between the theoretical and the practical education of pedagogues at the university level. Eleven university professors from departments of pedagogy and andragogy at the universities of Ljubljana and Belgrade were interviewed. The semi-structured interviews focused on two main research questions: 1) how they understand the relationship between pedagogical theory and practice, and the identity of pedagogy as a science in that context, and 2) their opinion about the competence-based approach in the context of the study of pedagogy. The findings show that the majority of the interviewed university teachers hold an opinion that pedagogy is primarily a theoretical (reflective) science and, accordingly, that the mastery of theory is crucial for the development of pedagogues' competences. Furthermore, most of them are rather reserved and critical of the competence approach as well as of the practical skills development. Although there are some differences in opinions between the professors from Ljubljana and Belgrade, this study shows that similar discourses pre-vail. The gap between pedagogical theory and practice is one of the major issues that have been current in pedagogical science in the recent decades. The findings of our research indicate that there is dissatisfaction with the relationship between modern pedagogical theory and practice, accompanied by the need for its reconceptualization.

Specifically, the relations between domain-specific epistemic beliefs about the development and justification of scientific knowledge, achievement goals, knowledge, self-concept, self-efficacy, and achievement in science were simultaneously examined. Students in fifth (n = 213), eighth (n = 202), and eleventh (n = 281) grades completed questionnaires measuring the various constructs, and a domain knowledge test. Their grades in science were also collected. Results from structural equation modeling reveal that the hypothesized model fitted the observed data at the three grade levels, although not all expected paths were statistically significant. Students' epistemic beliefs about the development of scientific knowledge had a direct effect on domain knowledge, whereas beliefs about the justification of scientific knowledge had a direct and an indirect effect via achievement goals on knowledge acquisition. Mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goals had a direct effect on self-efficacy. Knowledge had a direct and an indirect effect via self-concept on achievement. Educational implications are discussed.},

abstract = {(from the chapter) Over the last several decades, psychologists have grown increasingly interested in understanding how individuals think about the nature of knowledge and themselves as knowers. Research in this area has primarily focused upon the relationship between personal epistemologies and how individuals learn in settings of formal education. Against this backdrop, different epistemological perspectives have been presented as part of a hierarchical, developmental sequence anchored by dualistic, objective epistemologies at one end, and contextual, constructed ways of knowing at the opposite end. Embedded in such a trajectory is the implicit (and often explicit) assumption that not all epistemological beliefs are created equally; some are viewed as cognitively complex and superior, while others are positioned as primitive and less than ideal. Such a view discounts how different ways of knowing may be adaptive and functional across different ecological contexts. Similarly, it ignores the possibility that many individuals have objectives that differ from those promoted and rewarded by institutions of higher education. With this in mind, the purpose of this chapter is to address the biases and limitations inherent in current models of epistemological development. Using several theoretical models that explain the dynamic interweaving of psychological and social processes, epistemic perspectives will be examined as systems of meaning-making that reflect the values, goals, and practices of diverse social groups.

abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine how science teachers' epistemological beliefs impacted their use of authentic inquiry in science instruction. Participants in this multiple-case study included a total of four teachers who represented the middle, secondary and post-secondary levels. Based on the results of the pilot study conducted with a secondary science teacher, adjustments were made to the interview questions and observation protocol. Data collection for the study included semi-structured interviews, direct observations of instructional techniques, and the collection of artifacts. The cross case analysis revealed that the cases epistemological beliefs were mostly Transitional and the method of instruction used most was Discussion. Two of the cases exhibited consistent beliefs and instructional practices, whereas the other two exhibited beliefs beyond their instruction. The findings of this study support the literature on the influence of contextual factors and professional development on teacher beliefs and practice. The findings support and contradict literature relevant to the consistency of teacher beliefs with instruction. This study's findings revealed that the use of reform-based instruction, or Authentic Inquiry, does not occur when science teachers do not have the beliefs and experiences necessary to implement this form of instruction.

The review is based on the SET meta-validation model, drawing upon research reports published in peer-reviewed journals since 2000. Through the lens of validity, we consider both the more traditional research themes in the field of SET (i.e., the dimensionality debate, the ‘bias' question, and questionnaire design) and some recent trends in SET research, such as online SET and bias investigations into additional teacher personal characteristics. The review provides a clear idea of the state of the art with regard to research on SET, thus allowing researchers to formulate suggestions for future research. It is argued that SET remains a current yet delicate topic in higher education, as well as in education research. Many stakeholders are not convinced of the usefulness and validity of SET for both formative and summative purposes. Research on SET has thus far failed to provide clear answers to several critical questions concerning the validity of SET.},

abstract = {Empirical evidence has attested to the benefits of autonomy support in a classroom context, in facilitating students' autonomous motivation, well-being, creativity, engagement, and persistence. However, most interventional research aiming to increase teachers' autonomy-supportive behaviors has been conducted in school and college contexts, with few studies aimed at university tutors. The current study implemented a brief theory-driven autonomy-supportive intervention in university seminars and developed an observational checklist instrument to assess behavior change. Tutors who received brief training in autonomy-supportive teaching techniques showed significant increases from baseline in two important autonomy-supportive behaviors in their classes. Potential implications and suggestions for further development of the intervention are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Three types of investigations are identified: examinations of observed relationships between social experiences and belief understanding, attempts to facilitate the reasoning of children on the verge of belief understanding through experiences intended to compel children to face reasoning inconsistencies; and training studies demonstrating that children can be trained to understand belief over time through specific feedback experiences. A comparison of these studies reveals that experience is defined differently across them, resulting in varying and sometimes ambiguous implications for a theory-theory perspective on development.

Tenth-graders responded to questionnaires assessing beliefs concerning the justification of knowledge claims in science and the certainty/simplicity of knowledge about a particular scientific issue. Students in an experimental group, who read multiple conflicting documents concerning the issue of sun exposure and health, changed their domain-specific beliefs concerning personal justification and justification by multiple sources as well as their topic-specific beliefs concerning the certainty/simplicity of knowledge, whereas no such changes were observed in a control group, reading multiple consistent documents on the same issue. Moreover, students in the experimental group outperformed students in the control group on a measure of multiple-documents comprehension. Findings are considered in light of the existing literature on the change of epistemic beliefs and multiple-documents comprehension.},

abstract = {A growing body of work addresses the nature of epistemological development and epistemological beliefs: how individuals come to know, the theories and beliefs they hold about knowing, and the manner in which such epistemological premises are a part of and an influence on the cognitive processes of thinking and reasoning. This study investigates the dimensionality of personal epistemology as hypothesized in a recent review of the literature as well as the nature of disciplinary differences. First-year college students responded to a set of questionnaires that included an adaptation of a domain-general epistemological instrument and a discipline-focused questionnaire. Results suggest that there is an underlying dimensionality to epistemological theories that cuts across disciplinary domains, but that students, at least by the 1st year of college, discriminate as to how these theories differ by discipline. Disciplinary differences were strong, suggesting that 1st-year college students see knowledge in science as more certain and unchanging than in psychology, are more likely to regard personal knowledge and firsthand experience as a basis for justification of knowing in psychology than in science, view authority and expertise as the source of knowledge more in science than in psychology, and perceive that in science, more than in psychology, truth is attainable by experts. This contradicts existing research that suggests that epistemological development is domain general and that epistemological beliefs do not differ by discipline. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

The current research explored the effect of statistical training on college teachers' tendency to over-interpret student evaluation differences. A sample of 225 English, mathematics and psychology teachers evaluated statistical reports of student evaluation data corresponding to a fictional teacher's courses. Teachers from the three disciplines varied significantly in their statistics training, but there were no differences in their tendency to rate small, non-significant differences in student evaluations as indicative of the need to make improvements in a course. These results illustrate that statistical knowledge alone does not prevent the over-interpretation of student evaluation means.},

The intervention was based on constructivist teaching practices that incorporated teacher modeling of critical thinking of content, evaluation of multiple approaches to solving problems, and making connections to prior knowledge. Sixty-three students across 2 classrooms (one intervention [n = 31], one control [n = 32]) participated and completed questionnaires 5 times over the semester. Questionnaires measured students' epistemic beliefs, learning strategies, and levels of motivation for their statistics class. Results revealed that for students in the intervention class, their epistemic beliefs shifted midway through the semester, whereas students in the control group maintained a consistent level of beliefs throughout the semester. Intervention students' self-reported use of critical thinking and elaboration strategies also significantly increased midway through the semester, as did their levels of self-efficacy for learning statistics. In contrast, students in the control group maintained a consistent level of strategy use and self-efficacy. Finally, students in the intervention group had a significantly higher final grade compared with those in the control group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Twelve trained raters judged 57 videotaped lesson sequences with regard to aspects of domain-independent instructional quality. Additionally, 3 of these sequences were judged by 390 untrained raters (i.e., student teachers and teachers). Depending on scale level and dimension, 16–44{\%} of the variance in ratings could be attributed to instructional quality, whereas rater bias accounted for 12–40{\%} of the variance. Although the trained raters referred more often to aspects considered essential for instructional quality, this was not reflected in the reliability of their ratings. The results indicate that observer ratings should be treated in a more differentiated manner in the future.},

This is an example of Simpson's paradox, which although uncommon in practice, does, in fact, occur (Wainer H. Simpson's paradox. Chance 1999;12:43). More importantly, it is likely that in an observational study, a related result will occur; namely, ignoring sex in the analysis will lead to biased results. To better understand why Simpson's paradox and the related result occur, we present a graphic explanation.},

abstract = {Student evaluation of teaching (SET) is now common practice across higher education, with the results used for both course improvement and quality assurance purposes. While much research has examined the validity of SETs for measuring teaching quality, few studies have investigated the factors that influence student participation in the SET process. This study aimed to address this deficit through the analysis of an SET respondent pool at a large Canadian research-intensive university. The findings were largely consistent with available research (showing influence of student gender, age, specialisation area and final grade on SET completion). However, the study also identified additional influential course-specific factors such as term of study, course year level and course type as statistically significant. Collectively, such findings point to substantively significant patterns of bias in the characteristics of the respondent pool. Further research is needed to specify and quantify the impact (if any) on SET scores. We conclude, however, by recommending that such bias does not invalidate SET implementation, but instead should be embraced and reported within standard institutional practice, allowing better understanding of feedback received, and driving future efforts at recruiting student respondents.},

Learner characteristics, such as epistemic beliefs, influence SRL processing. Therefore, research into learning with CBLEs must account for interactions between epistemic beliefs and SRL. In this article we integrate epistemic belief frameworks and models of SRL, and we argue that both phenomena should be modeled as a dynamic series of events. Such modeling allows for an examination of how various epistemic beliefs may be activated and deactivated through the process of self-regulation. We also show how CBLEs can be used to measure epistemic beliefs in novel ways and study how epistemic beliefs and SRL interact. Finally, we identify areas for future research and educational implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Standardization procedures are classified according to the statistical information used (means, standard deviation) and the source of this information (individual, group, or culture). Second, empirical research in JCCP between 1970 and 2002 is reviewed. Standardization has become more common in the 1990s, and there is a trend to rely more on standardized data. Most studies used standardization prior to analysis of variance and factor analytical techniques. However, an analysis of statistical properties of standardized measures indicates that results based on standardization are ambiguous. The use of statistical techniques and the interpretation of results based on standardized data are discussed.},

abstract = {The use of interrater reliability (IRR) and interrater agreement (IRA) indices has increased dramatically during the past 20 years. This popularity is, at least in part, because of the increased role of multilevel modeling techniques (e.g., hierarchical linear modeling and mul- tilevel structural equation modeling) in organizational research. IRR and IRA indices are often used to justify aggregating lower-level data used in composition models. The purpose of the current article is to expose researchers to the various issues surrounding the use of IRR and IRA indices often used in conjunction with multilevel models. To achieve this goal, the authors adopt a question-and-answer format and provide a tutorial in the appendices illustrat- ing how these indices may be computed using the SPSS software.},

Although the reliability and validity of student perceptions of teaching are regularly confirmed, the student perspective in the evaluation of teaching is still viewed with scepticism. This study examines the effects of student feedback. For this purpose, 305 teachers who are users of a web-based student feedback system that is available in the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (Germany) were surveyed using a self-designed questionnaire. Using multiple regressions, self-reported changes in teaching can be predicted from existing levels of motivation and the constructiveness of the discussion between students and the classroom teacher. Externally motivated student feedback appears to lead to changes in the classroom as well. The results argue for the integration of student feedback into a school-wide quality management system. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Visual representations are essential for communicating ideas in the science classroom; however, the design of such representations is not always beneficial for learners. This paper presents instructional design considerations providing empirical evidence and integrating theoretical concepts related to cognitive load. Learners have a limited working memory, and instructional representations should be designed with the goal of reducing unnecessary cognitive load. However, cognitive architecture alone is not the only factor to be considered; individual differences, especially prior knowledge, are critical in deter- mining what impact a visual representation will have on learners' cognitive structures and processes. Prior knowledge can determine the ease with which learners can perceive and interpret visual representations in working memory. Although a long tradition of research has compared experts and novices, more research is necessary to fully explore the expert– C novice continuum and maximize the potential of visual representations. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Biology students (n = 25) and humanities students (n = 26) who varied in their epistemological beliefs learned with a hierarchical hypertext about the topic of genetic fingerprinting. During their learning processes, logfiles and questionnaire data were collected. Results indicate that students do metacognitively calibrate their learning process to the complexity of the presented learning material, e.g. by processing more complex deeper-level nodes longer. Furthermore, these calibration processes were significantly related to epistemological beliefs. For example, more 'sophisticated' epistemological beliefs were associated with processing more nodes, whereas more 'na{\{}$\backslash$"i{\}}ve' beliefs were related to spending more time on single nodes. Both effects were especially pronounced on deeper hierarchical hypertext levels. Prior domain knowledge also had an impact, especially on comprehensibility ratings: biology students considered all nodes more comprehensible than humanities students. Additionally, epistemological beliefs as well as prior domain knowledge were also significantly associated with the learning outcome: for example, more prior domain knowledge led to significantly higher learning outcome.

We developed a video-based instrument to empirically test the model. The results show that our measure to assess aspects of professional vision differentiates between description, explanation, and prediction.

abstract = {The prevailing view in the study of children's developing theories of mind is that the 4-year-old's newfound understanding of false belief is the single developmental milestone marking entry into an adult "folk psychology." We argue instead that there are at least two such watershed events. Children first develop a "copy theory" that equates the mind with a recording device capable of producing either faithful or flawed representations of reality and according to which mental states are determined entirely by the flow of information into the mind. Only later, in the early school years, do children come to appreciate, as do adults, that the mind itself can contribute to the content of mental states. This later-arriving "Interpretive Theory of Mind" allows an appreciation of the capacity for constructively interpreting and misinterpreting reality. The main finding from the six studies reported here is that children who otherwise demonstrate a clear understanding that beliefs can be false (and so deserve to be credited with a theory of mind), can nevertheless fail to appreciate even the most basic aspects of interpretation: that despite exposure to precisely the same information, two persons can still end up holding sharply different opinions about what is the self-same reality. What these studies reveal is that an interpretive theory of mind is different from, and later arriving than, an appreciation of the possibility of false belief, and contrary to competing claims, this interpretive theory actually makes its first appearance during, but not before, the early school years. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The synthesis of both methods developed by Muth{\'{e}}in (1994) is then presented in the simple case of a multilevel path analysis model, in which the variations in within‐group level intercepts are modeled as a function of between‐group variables following their own path model. An application motivated by a real problem in the field of education that focuses on validating indicators of the quality of science education in the United States follows. The results show that it is possible to statistically capture the salient complexities of organizations through the application of multilevel SEM.

Multilevel analyses yielded the following main results. First, a high percentage of variance was found between the judgments of the different theories. Second, theories with which participants were more familiar were judged less critically.

Eighty-three university undergraduate students completed questionnaires designed to measure their epistemic beliefs and prior knowledge about Newtonian physics. Students were epistemically profiled as rational, empirical, or metaphorical in their approaches to knowing. Using a think-aloud protocol, students read a text on Newton's First and Third Laws. The text included metaphors as examples of the various laws described. Results revealed that students profiled as metaphorical engaged in more metacognitive processing compared to students profiled as rational or empirical. Moreover, path analyses revealed that metacognitive monitoring positively predicted recall performance. Results challenge Muis' (2008) consistency hypothesis; the ways in which knowledge is represented in text may be the linking factor for relations between metacognitive monitoring and epistemic beliefs rather than the underlying epistemology of the domain.

abstract = {An illusion of explanatory depth (IOED) occurs when people believe they understand a concept more deeply than they actually do. To date, IOEDs have been identified only in mechanical and natural domains, occluding why they occur and suggesting that their implications are quite limited. Six studies illustrated that IOEDs occur because people adopt an inappropriately abstract construal style when they assess how well they understand concrete concepts. As this mechanism predicts, participants who naturally adopted concrete construal styles (Study 1) or were induced to adopt a concrete construal style (Studies 2-4 and 6), experienced diminished IOEDs. Two additional studies documented a novel IOED in the social psychological domain of electoral voting (Studies 5 and 6), demonstrating the generality of the construal mechanism, the authors also extended the presumed boundary conditions of the effect beyond mechanical and natural domains. These findings suggest a novel factor that might contribute to such diverse social-cognitive shortcomings as stereotyping, egocentrism, and the planning fallacy, where people adopt abstract representations of concepts that should be represented concretely.},

Models of role conflict, role ambiguity, time demands, social support, involvement and satisfaction, and work--family conflict were tested using structural equation modeling. Results suggest that social support may be best viewed as an antecedent to perceived stressors, and may reduce perceived role stressors (conflict and ambiguity) and time demands to indirectly decrease work--family conflict. Individuals who develop strong social support networks at work and at home may perceive fewer stressors in organizational and family life.

abstract = {Background: Recently research evidence emphasizes two main lines of inquiry, namely the relations between future time perspective (FTP), achievement goals (mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance) and study processing strategies, and the relations between epistemological beliefs, achievement goals and study processing strategies. To date, however, there have been very few attempts made to amalgamate these two strands of inquiry within one study and how they in totality determine the success of academic learning. Aims: This study proposed and tested a conceptual model of relationships among FTP, epistemological beliefs, achievement goals (mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance), study processing strategies and academic performance. Sample: Two hundred and seventy-five tertiary second-year students (167 females, 108 males) enrolled in a university in the Pacific participated in this study. Method: Likert-scale inventories were used to elicit relevant data from students; for example, the epistemological questionnaire (EQ; Schommer, 1990) and the Zimbardo time perspective inventory (Zimbardo {\{}{\&}{\}} Boyd, 1999). Academic performance was collated from students' course and final exam marks in the course educational psychology. LISREL 8.72 and SPSS 15 was used to test and evaluate the conceptual model proposed. Results: Latent variables procedures supported the conceptual model in general, although not all hypothesized paths were significant. MANOVA indicated no gender differences in the five theoretical frameworks or academic performance. Discussion: The determinants of academic performance from our findings are deep and surface processing strategies. Furthermore, the established supports the mediating roles of deep processing strategies, mastery goals, and performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals.

In educational research, student ratings are frequently used to assess aspects of instructional quality. The present study investigates two key aspects of construct validity in student ratings in domain independent assessments: (1) the dimensionality of ratings and (2) their generalizability across classes and two subjects (English and German lessons). A large, representative sample of N{\~{}}={\~{}}6909 ninth grade students from 280 classes was used and a structural model postulating five central dimensions of instructional quality (structure, classroom management, understandableness, motivation, student involvement) was tested by means of a two-level confirmatory factor analysis. The five-factor model adequately described the structure of student ratings. In terms of generalizability, the assumption of equal measurement properties of student ratings across classes held for some of the investigated dimensions (structure and classroom management), but not for others (understandableness, motivation, and student involvement). Possible explanations for these differences are finally discussed.},

In view of the high significance attributed to self-assessments in existing studies on the efficiency of teacher training, high correlations between self-assessment and knowledge are expected. The investigation is based on data from the comparative study TEDS-M relating to the participating countries of Germany and the United States. Correlative findings suggest that future teachers with a better test performance were more thoroughly convinced of being well-prepared for teaching. Contrary to the expectations, however, the correlations between knowledge and self-assessment are rather low and only statistically relevant in the case of future German primary teachers and of future secondary teachers in the US. In a final part, implications for the evaluation of the methodological approach to self-assessment procedures and for the professionalization of future teachers are discussed.

abstract = {In the present study it was investigated whether high school students are spontaneously able to reflect epistemologically during online searching for information about a controversial topic. In addition, we examined whether activating epistemic beliefs is related to individual characteristics, such as prior knowledge of the topic and argumentative reasoning skill; also whether learning from the Web is influenced by epistemic beliefs in action and the ability to detect fallacies in arguments. The participants (N = 64) were students of Grade 13, who were asked to think aloud during navigation. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Findings reveal that most participants spontaneously activated beliefs about all four dimensions identified in the literature, that is, about the simplicity/complexity, certainty/uncertainty, justification, and source of knowledge, at different levels of sophistication. Most epistemic reflections were about the source of knowledge. Two patterns of contextualized epistemic beliefs emerged and significantly influenced learning from the Web, which was also affected by participants' ability to identify argumentative fallacies.

abstract = {Attention to the beliefs of teachers and teacher candidates should be a focus of educational research and can inform educational practice in ways that prevailing research agendas have not and cannot. The difficulty in studying teachers' beliefs has been caused by definitional problems, poor conceptualizations, and differing under- standings of beliefs and belief structures. This article examines the meaning prominent researchers give to beliefs and how this meaning differs from that of knowledge, provides a definition of belief consistent with the best work in this area, explores the nature of belief structures as outlined by key researchers, and offers a synthesis of findings about the nature of beliefs. The article argues that teachers' beliefs can and should become an important focus of educational inquiry but that this will require clear conceptualizations, careful examination of key assumptions, consistent understand- ings and adherence to precise meanings, and proper assessment and investigation of specific belief constructs. Implications of findings and directions for future research are offered.},

abstract = {This paper tests the efficacy of an intervention program in virtual format intended to train studying and self-regulation strategies in university students. The aim of this intervention is to promote a series of strategies which allow students to manage their learning processes in a more proficient and autonomous way. The program has been developed in Moodle format and hosted by the Virtual Campus of the University of Oviedo. The present study had a semi-experimental design, included an experimental group (n=167) and a control one (n=206), and used pretest and posttest measures (self-regulated learning strategies' declarative knowledge, self-regulated learning macro-strategy planning-execution-assessment, self-regulated learning strategies on text, surface and deep learning approaches, and academic achievement). Data suggest that the students enrolled in the training program, comparing with students in the control group, showed a significant improvement in their declarative knowledge, general and on text use of learning strategies, increased their deep approach to learning, decreased their use of a surface approach and, in what concerns to academic achievement, statistically significant differences have been found in favour of the experimental group.},

The current study considers burnout in terms of the exchange of investments and outcomes at interpersonal (teacher--student) and organizational (teacher--school) levels. In addition, demographic (age and gender) and work-related factors (school type, teaching experience, number of hours employed) are included. Findings show that when teachers invest more than they get back from their school, they report higher levels of emotional exhaustion. As expected, at the interpersonal level, low outcomes from students are related to higher burnout levels; whereas at the organizational level, low investments are related to higher burnout levels. These findings are discussed in terms of the extent to which psychological contact is more intimate or impersonal in both types of relationships.

Kitchener also introduced the construct of epistemic cognition (Kitchener, 1983), a monitoring process that occurs in the solving of ill-structured problems. In this chapter, they explicate the relation between these constructs and review two decades of research on epistemic cognition and their seven-stage model of the development of reflective judgment. This model was empirically derived from individuals' responses to questions that elicit epistemological assumptions while reasoning about complex, open-ended problems. The authors explicate the roots of the concept of reflective judgment and how it is tied to epistemic cognition, provide a description of the model with illustrations from interviews with participants, and discuss the longitudinal and cross-sectional data on the model.

In the second experiment, focusing on whether the effects of task instructions on multiple-documents comprehension and integration could be moderated by students prior knowledge, it was found that only students with high prior knowledge were able to take advantage of instructions to construct arguments while reading, whereas low-knowledge readers seemed to be more hindered than helped by such task instructions.

abstract = {The traditional conception of validity divides it into three separate and substitutable types: content, criterion, and construct validities. This view is fragmented and incomplete, especially because it fails to take into account both evidence of the value implications of score meaning as a basis for action and the social consequences of score use. The new unified concept of validity interrelates these issues as fundamental aspects of a more comprehensive theory of construct validity that addresses both score meaning and social values in test interpretation and test use. That is, unified validity integrates considerations of content, criteria, and consequences into a construct framework for the empirical testing of rational hypotheses about score meaning and theoretically relevant relationships, including those of an applied and a scientific nature. Six distinguishable aspects of construct validity are highlighted as a means of addressing central issues implicit in the notion of validity as a unified concept. These are content, substantive, structural, generalizability, external, and consequential aspects of construct validity. In effect, these six aspects function as general validity criteria or standards for all educational and psychological measurement, including performance assessments, which are discussed in some detail because of their increasing emphasis in educational and employment settings.

abstract = {The contribution examines theoretical foundations, factorial structure, and predictive power of student ratings of teaching quality. Three basic dimensions of teaching quality have previously been described: classroom management, cognitive activation, and supportive climate. However, student ratings, especially those provided by primary school students, have been criticised for being biased by factors such as teacher popularity. The present study examines ratings of teaching quality and science learning among third graders. Results of multilevel confirmatory factor analyses (N=1556 students, 89 classes) indicate that the three-dimensional model of teaching quality can be replicated in ratings of third graders. In a longitudinal study (N=1070 students, 54 classes), we found ratings of classroom management to predict student achievement, and ratings of cognitive activation and supportive climate to predict students' development of subject-related interest after teacher popularity is controlled for. The analyses show that student ratings can be useful measures of teaching quality in primary school. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Examined individual differences in reading comprehension standards by asking 9 undergraduates enrolled in a "Fundamentals of Psychology" course to describe the criteria they used to decide whether or not they had comprehended textbook chapters. Ss were classified as having a dualistic (fact-oriented) or a relativistic (context-oriented) conception of knowledge on the basis of their ratings of attitude statements drawn from the work of W. G. Perry (1968). Comprehension criteria reported by dualists more often involved the knowledge category found in the B. S. Bloom et al (1956) book, Taxonomy, and those reported by relativists, the comprehension or application categories. The nature and number of reported comprehension criteria were found to be predictive of course grades. Ss reporting the use of comprehension or application criteria earned better grades than those reporting the use of knowledge criteria; Ss reporting the use of more than one criterion earned better grades than those reporting the use of a single criterion. These data suggest that one's epistemological beliefs may dictate one's choice of comprehension standards and that these epistemological standards, in turn, may control the effectiveness of one's text processing efforts.

abstract = {This article is a methodological-substantive synergy. Methodologically, we demonstrate latent-variable contextual models that integrate structural equation models (with multiple indicators) and multilevel models. These models simultaneously control for and unconfound measurement error due to sampling of items at the individual (L1) and group (L2) levels and sampling error due the sampling of persons in the aggregation of L1 characteristics to form L2 constructs. We consider a set of models that are latent or manifest in relation to sampling items (measurement error) and sampling of persons (sampling error) and discuss when different models might be most useful. We demonstrate the flexibility of these 4 core models by extending them to include random slopes, latent (single-level or cross-level) interactions, and latent quadratic effects. Substantively we use these models to test the big-fish-little-pond effect (BFLPE), showing that individual student levels of academic self-concept (L1-ASC) are positively associated with individual level achievement (L1-ACH) and negatively associated with school-average achievement (L2-ACH)—a finding with important policy implications for the way schools are structured. Extending tests of the BFLPE in new directions, we show that the nonlinear effects of the L1-ACH (a latent quadratic effect) and the interaction between gender and L1-ACH (an L1 × L1 latent interaction) are not significant. Although random-slope models show no significant school-to-school variation in relations between L1-ACH and L1-ASC, the negative effects of L2-ACH (the BFLPE) do vary somewhat with individual L1-ACH. We conclude with implications for diverse applications of the set of latent contextual models, including recommendations about their implementation, effect size estimates (and confidence intervals) appropriate to multilevel models, and directions for further research in contextual effect analysis.},

Psychol. 32(5), 519–542 (2001)) across three education groups in a population sample (N  =  1,677). The PVQ measures 10 basic values that Schwartz postulates to comprehensively describe the human values recognized in all societies (achievement, hedonism, self-direction, benevolence, conformity, security, stimulation, power, tradition and universalism). We also estimate and compare the latent means of the three education groups. The analyses show partial invariance for most of the 10 values and parameters. As expected, the latent means show that less educated respondents attribute more importance to security, tradition, and conformity values.},

For the first task, respondents graphically represented the interrelations of knowledge, information, and truth; the second task required them to justify those representations; and the third involved defining each term. Representations were compared to written justification to gauge consistency and data were analyzed to identify relational patterns, with six stable patterns emerging from the conceptions (e.g., knowledge establishment and truth establishment). A content analysis was performed to: (a) identify the specific language frequently used to define these terms, and (b) contrast definitions as a whole to conceptions that populate the psychological and related literatures. The significance of the resulting patterns is considered in light of the literature in epistemic beliefs and empirical implications and practical relevance are discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Beide Evaluationsans{\"{a}}tze richten ihr Augenmerk weniger auf schulische Outputs wie z. B. Sch{\"{u}}lerleistungen, sondern vielmehr auf schulische Prozesse wie Schulmanagement oder die Qualit{\"{a}}t des Unterrichts. Externe Evaluation in Form von Schulinspektion erf{\"{u}}llt vornehmlich die Funktion von Rechenschaftslegung und der Identifizierung schwacher Schulen. Zur Unterst{\"{u}}tzung der Schulentwicklung ist die interne Evaluation vermutlich besser geeignet. Um sie jedoch als systematischen Prozess der Qualit{\"{a}}tsentwicklung in Verantwortung der Einzelschule betreiben zu k{\"{o}}nnen, fehlt es aktuell an der n{\"{o}}tigen Kompetenz. {\"{U}}berlegungen zum zuk{\"{u}}nftigen Verh{\"{a}}ltnis von interner und externer Evaluation richten sich darauf, externe Evaluation als "Meta-Evaluation" zu betreiben. Bevor externe Evaluation jedoch in dieser Art auf Ergebnisse interner Evaluation aufbauen kann, ist ein breiter Kompetenzaufbau in den Schulen als auch ein anderes Rollenverst{\"{a}}ndnis der Inspektoren n{\"{o}}tig. (DIPF/Orig.).;;;The overview article deals with the interaction of internal and external evaluation within the current paradigm of school governance. The actual practice of both approaches and the current state of research about the effects on school development is described. Both evaluation approaches are less focused on aspects of school output such as student performance, and more on school processes such as school management or the quality of teaching. External evaluation in the form of school inspection mainly fulfills the function of accountability and the identification of weak schools. Internal evaluation is probably a better way to achieve school development. However, the necessary competence to use internal evaluation as a systematic process of quality management for which each individual school takes responsibility is currently underdeveloped. Considerations about the future relationship between internal and external evaluation focus on using external evaluation as a kind of "meta-evaluation". But before external evaluation can build on results of internal evaluation in this way, a broad capacity building in schools and a different understanding of the role of inspectors are necessary.

abstract = {Three studies are reported that investigated the relationship between secondary school students' physics-related epistemological beliefs and physics conceptual understanding. Study 1 involved the development of a Greek Epistemological Beliefs Evaluation Instrument for Physics (GEBEP) which was administered to 394 students (10th graders). Study 2 investigated the hypothesis that physics epistemological sophistication as measured by the GEBEP is a good predictor of physics understanding. The participants were selected from the 394 students who participated in Study 1. More specifically we selected the 10{\%} (38) students with the highest scores in the GEBEP (high epistemological sophistication group, HES) and the 10{\%} (38) students with the lowest GEBEP scores (low epistemological sophistication group, LES) and measured their understanding of Newton's three laws using the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation instrument (FMCE) developed by Thornton and Sokoloff (1998). The results showed that the HES group had significantly higher scores in the FMCE than the LES group. Regression analysis showed that beliefs regarding the Construction and Stability of physics knowledge and the Structure of physics knowledge were good predictors of physics understanding. Study 3 re-examined the same hypothesis on a new independent sample of students. The results based on the entire sample, showed again that beliefs regarding the Construction and Stability of physics knowledge predicted physics understanding. Overall, the results suggest that sophisticated physics-related epistemological beliefs are necessary but not sufficient for physics understanding and point to the importance of taking them into consideration in physics education.},

First, the study shows that the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Coping with Disruptive Behaviour Scale and the Perceived Disruptive Behaviour Scale could be adapted to students to report perceived burnout symptoms among their teachers, the occurrence of perceived disruptive student behaviour and the students' perception of their teachers' competence to cope with disruptive student behaviour. Second, students' perceptions do not differ according to their age. Third, we found that there was a significant difference between the perceptions of male and female students in respect of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, but not in respect of personal accomplishment. Fourth, according to the students' perceptions, a considerable percentage of variance in each of the three burnout dimensions was explained by teachers' competence to cope with student disruptive behaviour and perceived disruptive student behaviour.

Using survey response data collected from 6,549 sales employees in 119 stores of a national retail company, Study 1 compared the results of six interrater agreement indices across four types of Likert-type response scales (i.e., 5-, 6-, 7-, and 11-point scales). The results indicated that the AD indices were highly correlated with an index of proportional agreement and with within-group inter- rater agreement indices. Study 2, based on survey data collected from 4,158 sales employees in 109 other stores of this company, constructively replicated Study 1 and examined the consistency of interrater agreement decisions across six indices with respect to a priori decision rules. Study 2 results also supported the use of AD indices. Practical issues concerning the use of AD indices for estimating interrater agreement and future research directions are discussed.},

The analyses included (1) a replication of the S. C. Snook and R. L.

In contrast to the findings by W. F. Velicer and D. N. Jackson (see record 1990-27325-001) in this area, the present results suggest that there were systematic differences between POPPs defined by PCA and CFA and that these differences were present even when the correct number of dimensions was retained. Also, the POPPs defined by CFA may have been more generalizable than those defined by PCA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

College students completed an epistemological questionnaire with a specific domain in mind (either social sciences or mathematics), read a passage (either social sciences or mathematics), answered a passage test, and completed another epistemological questionnaire with the alternative domain in mind. Results support the idea that individuals' epistemological beliefs tend to be domain independent. Mathematical epistemological factors correlated with the corresponding social science epistemological factors. Epistemological beliefs in both domains predicted passage comprehension similarly, and most students showed a consistent level of epistemological sophistication across domains.

We made two predictions. We anticipated that the majority of students would hold consistent world views across the 13-week semester, and that indi- viduals with inconsistent beliefs would move from a realist (i.e. teacher-centred) to contextualist (i.e. student-centred) world view. Results indicated that approximately 55{\%} of the participants expressed consistent beliefs. In addition, participants who did not self- report consistent beliefs typically moved from a realist to a more contextualist world view by the end of the semester. We discuss the role of active reflection as a component of the learning environment that enhances the development of beliefs.},

abstract = {Examined the relationship between beliefs about the nature of knowledge and conceptions of prose coherence by administering self-reports to 89 undergraduates. Four conceptions of coherence were identified. Two of these conceptions (informativeness and grouping) were categorized as immature because they did not provide a basis for evaluating the quality of the relationships among the various parts of a term paper. The 2 remaining conceptions (sequencing and unity) were categorized as mature because they did provide such a basis. Results show that Ss classified as having relativistic (context-oriented) beliefs about the nature of knowledge were more likely to report mature coherence conceptions than were Ss classified as having dualistic (fact-oriented) beliefs. In addition, Ss who reported mature coherence conceptions produced essays that were judged by 2 writing instructors to be more coherent than the essays of Ss who reported immature conceptions.

abstract = {Empirical studies reveal a close relationship between epistemological beliefs ({\{}EBs){\}} and metacognition. For example, more ‘sophisticated' beliefs are associated with more self-reported monitoring strategies. This relationship is also advocated theoretically. Nevertheless, exactly how and why {\{}EBs{\}} impact learning is still an open question. In accordance with others (for example Muis 2007; Muis and Franco 2009) we conceive the {\{}COPES{\}} Model (Winne and Hadwin 1998) as an appropriate answer to the how question. Within that model, epistemological beliefs are conceptualized as ‘internal conditions of learning' and they are embedded into recursive processes of self- regulation. With regard to the why question, we assume that {\{}EBs{\}} function as general ideas about knowledge for the apprehension of the content to be learnt. Such apprehension allows for the calibration of learning to different learning tasks. We review two clusters of studies on the preparatory and the enactment stages of learning testing this apprehension and calibration hypothesis.},

abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), path analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) have long histories in clinical research. Although CFA has largely superseded EFA, CFAs of multidimensional constructs typically fail to meet standards of good measurement: goodness of fit, measurement invariance, lack of differential item functioning, and well-differentiated factors in support of discriminant validity. Part of the problem is undue reliance on overly restrictive CFAs in which each item loads on only one factor. Exploratory SEM (ESEM), an overarching integration of the best aspects of CFA/SEM and traditional EFA, provides confirmatory tests of a priori factor structures, relations between latent factors and multigroup/multioccasion tests of full (mean structure) measurement invariance. It incorporates all combinations of CFA factors, ESEM factors, covariates, grouping/multiple-indicator multiple-cause (MIMIC) variables, latent growth, and complex structures that typically have required CFA/SEM. ESEM has broad applicability to clinical studies that are not appropriately addressed either by traditional EFA or CFA/SEM.},

Based on two longitudinal cohorts (Grades 2 e5; Grades 4e7), latent growth models were used to analyze the development of achievement emotions and coping strategies separately as well as simultaneously. The results show that enjoyment decreases across grades, whereas boredom increases, with substantial changes between Grade 5 and Grade 7. Consistently, the development of enjoyment is positively associated with the development of problem-focused coping and palliative emotion regulation, whereas the development of boredom is positively associated with the development of avoidant coping and anger-related emotion regulation. Moreover, the relation between problem-focused coping and boredom, as well as between avoidant coping and enjoyment, depends on the age group. The results are discussed regarding the organization of learning environments in classes to prevent unfavorable developmental patterns of achievement emotions.},

It is shown that the issue of heterogeneity is linked with homogeneity, with different levels within the fields of schooling, and with discursive applications through lines of tension. The term is used above all in the context of socio-cultural categories and in the context of performance heterogeneity. The author criticizes a curtailed and ontologizing understanding of heterogeneity and, conversely, points to the construction of (conceptions of) heterogeneity within the field of schools itself. He pleads for a cultural-theoretical perspective which conceives of heterogeneity not as a {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}fact{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}, but rather as a process of applying methods of differentiation which can be reconstructed empirically.

In particular, changes in global preprogram beliefs about education, teach- ing, and learning were traced as preservice teachers acquired specific knowledge of how to manage, assess, and instructional{\^{}}facilitate students' learning through text. Researchers interviewed and observed 14 elementary and secondary preservice teachers as they entered the teacher education program, attended reading classes at the university, then taught reading in school classrooms. These qualitative data were analyzed to determine (a) the patterns of intellectual change from novice preservice teacher to beginning classroom teacher; (b) the personal, program, and contextual influences or constraints on that change; (c) the role of the cooperating teacher and university supervisor in supporting intellectual change; and (d) the nature of prior beliefs on identity maintenance while learning. Findings include the importance of understanding preservice teachers' prior beliefs to inform supervision and university course design, the value of cognitive dissonance in practice teaching contexts, the need to routinize classroom management knowledge before attending to subject-specific pedagogy, and the importance of the academic task as part of the teaching knowledge base.},

The teaching in this context usually focuses on how to help students enhance their professional skills and pass the certificate examinations, particularly for computing courses. However, due to national education policy, pure online courses are not permitted here and in some other nations. In order to provide an appropriate design and arrangement of blended learning (BL) courses, the authors redesigned a course, integrating web-enabled self-regulated learning (SRL) with variations in online class frequency, and explored their effects on enhancing students' skills of deploying database management system (DBMS) and their thoughts regarding blended course and interventions concerning SRL. Three class sections with a total of 112 students were taken as three distinct groups. The results indicated that students in the group of SRL and BL with five online classes had the highest grades for using DBMS among the three groups, and had very positive thoughts regarding the interventions concerning BL and SRL. The authors also provide suggestions and implications for teachers and schools to adopt innovative teaching methods and technologies, and redesign their courses to help students learn.},

abstract = {Der Beitrag thematisiert die Kompetenzentwicklung im Lehrerstudium und im {\"{U}}bergang in die Berufst{\"{a}}tigkeit. Das mehrperspektivisch angelegte Forschungsdesign erm{\"{o}}glichte, zu Beginn (t1), in der Mitte (t2) und am Schluss der Ausbildung (t3) von Studierenden der Primarstufe (1.–6. Klasse) an zwei P{\"{a}}dagogischen Hochschulen in der Schweiz sowie von jungen Lehrpersonen am Anfang (t4) und am Ende des ersten Jahres im Beruf (t5) in insgesamt elf Bereichen Daten zu erheben. Pr{\"{a}}sentiert werden Ergebnisse von Daten, die in zwei Bereichen zu jedem der f{\"{u}}nf Messzeitpunkte aufgenommen wurden: (a) Mit Vignetten wurde das Wissen {\"{u}}ber das Planen von Unterricht erhoben. (b) In den Praktika w{\"{a}}hrend des Studiums sowie im ersten Jahr im Beruf wurden die Versuchspersonen beim Unterrichten auf Video aufgezeichnet. Dieselben Daten wurden mit Praxislehrpersonen erhoben, die ma{\ss}geblich an der berufpraktischen Ausbildung der Studierenden beteiligt sind. Die Aussagen zu den Vignetten wurden inhaltsanalytisch ausgewertet. Die Unterrichtsvideos wurden mit niedrig-inferentem Kodieren hinsichtlich des sichtbaren Unterrichtsgeschehens analysiert und mit hoch-inferentem Rating bez{\"{u}}glich der Qualit{\"{a}}t des Unterrichts beurteilt. Die Ergebnisse, einschlie{\ss}lich jene aus dem Vergleich der Studierenden und Lehrpersonen im ersten Berufsjahr (Novizen) mit den Praxislehrpersonen (Experten), lassen R{\"{u}}ckschl{\"{u}}sse auf die Wirksamkeit der Ausbildung zu sowie hinsichtlich der Auswirkungen der Praxiserfahrung im ersten Berufsjahr auf das Wissen {\"{u}}ber (a) das Planen von Unterricht sowie (b) die Art und die Qualit{\"{a}}t des Unterrichts, der auf Video aufgenommen wurde. Insgesamt kann der neuen Ausbildung an den beiden P{\"{a}}dagogischen Hochschulen ein erfreulicher Professionalisierungserfolg attestiert werden. Erkennbar wird jedoch auch, wo und inwiefern in Bezug auf die Professionalisierung von Lehrpersonen Entwicklungsbedarf besteht.},

Moreover, the model includes several existing multidimensional models as special cases, including Whitely's multicomponent latent trait model, Andersen's multidimensional Rasch model for repeated testing, and Embretson's multidimensional Rasch model for learning and change. Marginal maximum likelihood estimators for the model are derived and the estimation is examined using a simulation study.

abstract = {Different measures of people's beliefs about the nature of knowledge and learning are described along with the theories upon which they are based. The initial theories tended to be unidimensional developmental theories and their measuring instruments lengthy, in-depth interviews. More recently, multidimensional theories have emerged that provide a more complex theory of epistemology. Recent measuring instruments are attempting to address these complexities using paper-and-pencil questionnaires that are easy to score. The measuring instruments differ considerably on what dimensions they measure and researchers are urged to select carefully the one that best matches their purpose. Specific descriptive information is provided regarding selected in- struments to aid researchers in their choices. Both theory and psychometric properties are considered critical issues for the decision-making process. KEY},

abstract = {In this article we discuss, illustrate, and compare the relative efficacy of three recommended approaches for handling negative error variance estimates (i.e., Heywood cases): (a) setting the offending estimate to zero, (b) adopting a model parameterization that ensures positive error variance estimates, and (c) using models with equality constraints that ensure nonnegative (but possibly zero) error variance estimates. The three approaches are evaluated in two distinct situations: Heywood cases caused by lack of fit and misspecification error, and Heywood cases induced from sampling fluctuations. The results indicate that in the case of sampling fluctuations the simple approach of setting the offending estimate to zero works reasonably well. In the case of lack of fit and misspecification error, the theoretical difficulties that give rise to negative error variance estimates have no ready-made methodological solutions.

abstract = {People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.},

In particular, they provide a useful framework for investigating learning and teaching for first year students in tertiary education, who are typically considered to hold less sophisticated epistemological beliefs. Using semi-structured interviews, this study investigated the nature of beliefs about knowing and learning of 35 first year teacher education and creative writing students at a large metropolitan university in Australia. The interview analysis indicated that a relationship existed between individuals' core beliefs about knowing and their beliefs about learning. This relationship has implications for the way in which we support first year students' learning as they transition into university and progress through their courses.},

Two hundred one undergraduate students from an educational psychology course completed questionnaires designed to measure the various constructs. Students' final grades were also collected at the end of the semester. Students' recollections of course tasks revealed that their epistemic beliefs are activated during learning. Results from structural equation modeling revealed epistemic beliefs influenced the types of achievement goals students adopted, which subsequently influenced the types of learning strategies they used in their education course, and their achievement.

By specifically focusing on the concept of teaching, the author examines whether a change from a rather profession-related use of the term towards a disciplinary use grounded on scientific theories can be shown to have occurred. Subject of this investigation are definitions of the concept of teaching as they appear in pedagogical reference books published between 1949 and 2007. The findings are significant both for educational science and for empirical scientific research: on the one hand, they reveal that school pedagogy has steadily clung to a practice-oriented concept of teaching, atypical of scientific disciplines. On the other hand, they show that the sounding of a discipline has to go beyond surveying general scientific indicators by including content-related analyses of relevant communication.

Sixty subjects from three age/educational levels (high school, college, and graduate school) were administered the Reflective Judgment Interview. In addi- tion, subjects were tested on four other factors hypothesized to affect reflective judgment scores. Two were competing theoretical constructs: verbal ability (using Terman's Concept Mastery Test) and Piagetian formal operations (chemicals and pendulum tasks); and two were potentially confounding factors: socio-economic status (using Hollingshead's two-factor index) and verbal fluency (number of words spoken during the interview). Highly significant differences (p {\textless} .001) were found on reflective judgment level between the three age/educational groups, and could not be statistically accounted for by scores earned on mea- sures of the other four factors. Whereas verbal ability was found to be closely related to reflective judgment level, the differences between groups on reflective judgment could not be solely attributed to this factor.},

abstract = {A hierarchical logistic regression model is proposed for studying data with group structure and a binary response variable. The group structure is defined by the presence of micro observations embedded within contexts (macro observations), and the specification is at both of these levels. At the first (micro) level, the usual logistic regression model is defined for each context. The same regressors are used in each context, but the micro regression coefficients are free to vary over contexts. At the second level, the micro coefficients are treated as functions of macro regressors. An empirical Bayes estimation procedure is proposed for estimating the micro and macro coefficients. Explicit formulas are provided that are computationally feasible for large-scale data analyses; these include an algorithm for finding the maximum likelihood estimates of the covariance components representing within- and between-macro-equation error variability. The methodology is applied to World Fertility Survey data, with individuals viewed as micro observations and countries as macro observations.},

Theory of mind, metacognition, and reasoning: A life-span perspective. In P. Mitchell {\&} K. J. Riggs (Eds.), Children's reasoning and the mind (pp. 301-326). Hove, UK: Psychology Press], which includes three levels of thinking about knowledge and knowing: absolutist, multiplist, and evaluativist. The study involved 881 Italian elementary (5th grade), middle (8th grade) and high school students (11th and 13th grades). The latter attended two different branches of high school, one following a scientific, and the other a technical-commercial curriculum. Their epistemological understanding was assessed in the five judgement domains included in the instrument developed by Kuhn, Cheney, and Weinstock (2000) [Kuhn, D., Cheney, R., {\&} Weinstock, M. (2000). The development of epistemological understanding. Cognitive Development, 15, 309-328). Data show that more than 70{\%} of identified patterns were consistent and interpretable within the underlying theoretical framework. Absolutist positions were more frequent in judgments about values even when the shift to non-absolutism was attained in all other domains. Gender, grade level, and curriculum significantly differentiated participants for the first developmental transition, from absolutism to multiplism. Overall, boys showed more absolutist positions than girls, 8th graders more than 13th graders, and participants in the scientific branch more than those in the technical-commercial one. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Two hundred sixty-eight students were sampled from undergraduate mathematics and statistics courses. Students completed inventories reflecting their epistemic profiles and learning strategies, and were profiled as rational, empirical, or both. Based on their profiles, 24 students participated in two problem-solving sessions. Episodes were coded for planning, monitoring, control, use of empirical and rational argumentation, and justification for solutions. For both self-reported metacognitive self-regulation and regulation of cognition during problem solving, students profiled as rational had the highest self-reported mean and actual frequency of regulation of cognition compared to students profiled as predominantly empirical. Moreover, students profiled as predominantly rational correctly solved more problems than the other two groups. Finally, students' approaches to problem solving were consistent with their epistemic profiles. Relations are discussed in the context of various theoretical frameworks. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A stratified random sampling technique was used to assess the epistemological beliefs of 386 students at three universities in central Illinois. Confirming previous research, the results suggest that epistemological beliefs can be represented in terms of five factors: (a) certainty of knowledge, (b) omniscient authority, (c) orderly process, (d) innate ability, and (e) quick learning. Students who study in the "soft" fields (i.e., social science and arts/ humanities) have a stronger tendency to believe that knowledge is uncertain, are more reliant on their independent reasoning ability, and have a stronger feeling that learning is not an orderly process than students in "hard" fields (i.e., engineering and business). Graduate students showed a stronger tendency than undergraduate students to believe that knowledge is often uncertain, that learning is not usually an orderly process, and that knowledge is best acquired from independent reasoning. The results of this study suggest that students' beliefs about learning are a product of the activity, the culture, and the context in which they are cultivated.},

abstract = {A challenge to successful teaching involves knowing how to address students' motivational and cognitive processes in relation to appropriate instruction. Some research has revealed that school tasks are important factors affecting student self-efficacy, motivation, cognition, and participation in instruction and learning. More understanding of the interaction between aspects of motivation, instruction, learning, and performance through a temporal analysis of problem solving in a normal classroom context is needed. This study traced the self-efficacy judgments of an experimental group of 89 grade ten students in a sectarian school as they worked on two differently designed learning tasks in their regular science class. The first task was ill structured. This task gave students significant choices about how to complete it, did not have identifiable steps or sub-goals, required students to search for and gather their own information and resources, and did not include specific criteria for grading. The second task was well structured. It was structured with particular sub-tasks, came with a packet of necessary resources, and included specific grading criteria. The experimental group and a comparison sample of 358 students from four public schools were also administered measures assessing their epistemological beliefs and perceptions of task or course difficulty. The main objectives of the study were to note differences in reported levels of self-efficacy for learning, self efficacy for performance, and epistemological beliefs according to the structure of each task and to study how these related to achievement. It was anticipated that most students would demonstrate significantly lower performance scores, lower and more unstable perceptions of self-efficacy for learning, self-efficacy for performance, and more harmful beliefs about learning and knowledge in the context of an ill-structured task than a well structured task. Self-efficacy for learning was expected to be lower than self-efficacy for performance on both tasks. Epistemological beliefs of the experimental, sample appeared to vary considerably from the comparison group so this variable was not examined further. Other results of the study support some of the hypotheses. Students reported significantly higher levels of self-efficacy for the well-structured task. Academic achievement and self-efficacy for learning were more predictive of achievement on the ill-structured task. Self-efficacy for learning was significantly lower, less stable, and more predictive of task achievement than self-efficacy for performance especially in the early phases of each task. These and other results suggest that features in both tasks may be difficult for students particularly early in task engagement when levels of self-efficacy for performance and learning differ most. Implications about the influence of each measured construct on achievement and impressions of task difficulty were discussed in hopes of bridging the theoretical gap between students' motivational and cognitive processes and constructive learning tasks.

abstract = {In educational research, characteristics of the learning environment (e.g., social climate, instructional quality, goal orientation) are often assessed via student reports, and their associations with outcome variables such as school achievement or student motivation then tested. However, studying the effects of the learning environment presents a series of methodological challenges. This article discusses three crucial elements in research that uses student reports to gauge the impact of the learning environment on student outcomes. First, from a conceptual point of view, it is argued that ratings aggregated at the relevant level (e.g., class or school level), and not individual student ratings, are of primary interest in these studies. Second, the reliability of aggregated student ratings must be routinely assessed before these perceptions are related to outcome variables. Third, researchers conducting multilevel analyses need to make very clear which centering option was chosen for the predictor variables. This article shows that conclusions about the impact of learning environments can be substantially affected by the choice of a specific centering option for the individual student ratings. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper presents a procedure to test factorial invariance in multilevel confirmatory factor analysis. When the group membership is at level 2, multilevel factorial invariance can be tested by a simple extension of the standard procedure. However level-1 group membership raises problems which cannot be appropriately handled by the standard procedure, because the dependency between members of different level-1 groups is not appropriately taken into account. The procedure presented in this article provides a solution to this problem. This paper also shows Muth{\'{e}}n's maximum likelihood (MUML) estimation for testing multilevel factorial invariance across level-1 groups as a viable alternative to maximum likelihood estimation. Testing multilevel factorial invariance across level-2 groups and testing multilevel factorial invariance across level-1 groups are illustrated using empirical examples.

@article{Kang2008,
abstract = {The purpose of this study was to understand what personal epistemologies and science teaching goals preservice secondary science teachers of a teacher education program in the USA bring with them to their learning to teach and how they translate such beliefs into actions. A set of essay questions, developed through a pilot study, was used to identify preservice teachers' personal epistemologies and teaching goals at the beginning of science methods instruction. Classroom observation reports, video recorded teaching episodes, lesson plans and self-video reflections were collected to identify connections between their epistemologies, teaching goals, and practice of teaching. Relational and ontological dimensions of epistemological beliefs were found to be useful for understanding preservice teachers' personal epistemologies and teaching practices. The data suggests that the participants' espoused teaching goals were relevant to their personal epistemologies when differentiating na??ve personal epistemologies from the sophisticated, and their emerging teaching practices demonstrated shifts in personal epistemologies and potential for further development in teaching practices. Findings indicate sources of how teaching practices are shaped. Implications for teacher education include needs for addressing ways to deal with teaching constraints for constructivist teaching approaches, collaboration with content course instructors, critical reflection on field experience, and developing induction programs that support continuing development of emerging teaching practices.},

Questionnaires were collected from 166 teachers from six secondary schools in the greater London area. The European reference group consisted of 2,017 teachers from 10 other countries who participated in the EUROTEACH Project. Regression analyses show that of the Karasek components, job demands was the most consistent predictor for the study outcomes, whereas control and social support appeared to have less predictive power. The inclusion of other job aspects (e.g., physical exertion, environmental risks, and job meaningfulness) significantly added varying degrees to the explained variance of the outcomes. The addition of coping strategies marginally adds to overall explained variances of the burnout components. The UK teachers were considerably worse off than their European colleagues on all outcome measures, and the majority of the predictor variables. They appear to use different coping strategies, work under worse conditions and report lower levels of psychological and physical well-being.

However, the relations between and the reciprocal conditionality of such cognitive and non-cognitive elements has so far hardly been examined closely, neither theoretically nor empirically. The contribution meets this desideratum by examining the relation between job-specific motivation and pedagogical knowledge among students in teacher training on the basis of a representative sample of freshmen in North Rhine-Westphalia. The results show that, statistically, specific motives for the choice of profession (e.g. intrinsic value) correlate significantly with pedagogical knowledge; however, the ratios are rather small. As was expected, correlative findings as well as a path-analytical modeling of motives for the choice of profession, measures of general achievement motivation and of learning/achievement motivation during the course of studies show that motives for the choice of profession are distal factors, whereas measures of learning/achievement motivation during the course of studies are proximal motivational factors with which pedagogical knowledge is associated. The findings are discussed in view of the significance of cognitive and motivational prerequisites of students in teacher training for the development of professional competence during the first phase of teacher training.

Therefore, the present study analyses linkages between parents' epistemological beliefs, their socio-economic status, and their instructional strategies during homework situations. A total of 208 German 5th graders and their parents participating in a longitudinal study were asked to rate parental instructional strategies in terms of autonomy support, structure, control and emotional assistance. In addition, parents, epistemological beliefs as well as their SES were assessed. Results suggest that more relativistic epistemological beliefs are associated with higher skill levels but were linked to parents' instructional strategies in a somewhat contradictory manner.

Correlational and path analyses revealed that teacher involvement was central to children's experiences in the classroom and that teacher provision of both autonomy support and optimal structure predicted children's motivation across the school year. Reciprocal effects of student motivation on teacher behavior were also found. Students who showed higher initial behavioral engagement received subsequently more of all 3 teacher behaviors. These findings suggest that students who are behaviorally disengaged receive teacher responses that should further undermine their motivation. The importance of the student--teacher relationship, especially interpersonal involvement, in optimizing student motivation is highlighted.

Using simulation data, the authors first examine whether there is any empirical evidence for the use of a universal cutoff, and then compare the practice of using the point estimate of the RMSEA alone versus that of using it jointly with its related confidence interval. The results of the study demonstrate that there is little empirical support for the use of .05 or any other value as universal cutoff values to determine adequate model fit, regardless of whether the point estimate is used alone or jointly with the confidence interval. The authors' analyses suggest that to achieve a certain level of power or Type I error rate, the choice of cutoff values depends on model specifications, degrees of freedom, and sample size.},

A sample of 342 11th and 12th graders (age M = 16.94; SD = .71) was investigated. Students gave self-reports on domain-specific values, ability self-perceptions, goals, and achievement motives. Hierarchical regression and relative weights analyses were performed with grades in math and German as dependent variables and intelligence as well as motivational measures as independent variables. Beyond intelligence, different motivational constructs incrementally contributed to the prediction of school achievement. Domain-specific ability self-perceptions and values showed the highest increments whereas achievement motives and goal orientations explained less additional variance. Even when prior achievement was controlled, some motivational concepts still proved to contribute to the prediction of subsequent performance.

abstract = {In a sample of 135 Norwegian education undergraduates, we examined the effects of topic-specific epistemic beliefs concerning the simplicity and source of knowledge on deep-level understanding of multiple expository texts about the same topic-climate change. The results showed that students holding sophisticated simplicity beliefs, viewing knowledge about climate change as complex, gained better multiple-text understanding than did students holding na{\"{i}}ve simplicity beliefs, viewing knowledge about climate change as simple. However, students holding sophisticated source beliefs, viewing knowledge about climate change as personal construction, performed poorer than did students holding na{\"{i}}ve source beliefs, viewing knowledge about climate change as transmitted from experts. Moreover, students believing knowledge to be complex and, simultaneously, relying on expert authors were at a particular advantage with respect to multiple-text understanding. Thus, in this complex reading-task context, source beliefs usually located at the sophisticated ends of epistemic belief continuums turned out to be maladaptive, presumably because they distracted from the building of a high-quality representation of author and text meaning. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Study I qualitatively examined 53 preservice and 57 practicing teachers' beliefs about teaching, in order to: (1) ensure that the voices of teachers were made prevalent in the development of a framework aimed at understanding their beliefs and (2) facilitate the development of a quantitative measure to assess these beliefs. Results indicated that participants valued several aspects of teaching knowledge and held complex beliefs related to the implicit theories of teaching ability. Study I concludes with a framework for developing an instrument to assess teachers' beliefs. Study II describes two instruments developed to assess the beliefs identified in Study 1. Using responses from 351 preservice teachers, exploratory factor analysis procedures identified factors reflective of emergent themes from Study I.

abstract = {Proposes the coordination of the subjective and objective dimensions of knowing as the essence of what develops in the attainment of mature epistemological understanding. The authors argue that initially, the objective dimension dominates, to the exclusion of subjectivity; subsequently, the subjective dimension assumes an ascendant position and the objective is abandoned, and, finally, the 2 are coordinated. This progression, the authors further postulate, tends to occur in a systematic order across different judgment domains (personal taste, aesthetic, value, and truth), with the orders the reverse of one another in the 2 major transitions that constitute this progression. These predictions are supported in 2 studies among a sample of 7 groups of children, adolescents, and adults varying in age, education, and life experience. Subjectivity is most readily acknowledged in personal taste and aesthetic judgments and least readily in truth judgments. Once subjectivity is accepted and becomes dominant, objectivity is reintegrated in the reverse order, i.e., most readily with respect to truth judgments. Not predicted, however, was the finding that for a number of individuals, both transitions proved most difficult in the values domain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

In this review, we give an overview of twentieth-century homework research and discuss the reasons why the relationship between homework and achievement remains unclear. We identify the operationalization of homework and achievement and the problematic handling of hierarchically ordered data as two important factors affecting the validity of many of the studies performed over the last century. We then describe a new generation of homework studies using multilevel modeling to deal with hierarchically nested data. Finally, we argue that homework research should be more closely connected to well-founded psychological theories of learning and instruction, and we offer three potential links (theories of instruction time, self-regulation theory and expectancy-value theory, and teaching behavior).},

abstract = {Classical educational research provides empirical evidence of the positive effect of doing homework on academic results. Nonetheless, when this effect is analyzed in detail there are inconsistent, and in some cases, contradictory results. The central aim of this study was to systematically investigate the effect of homework on performance of students in mathematics and science using multilevel models. The original sample consisted of 7,725 Spanish adolescents with a mean age of 13.78 (±0.82) of which 7,451 were evaluated after purging the sample of the students who did little to no homework. A 2-level hierarchical-linear analysis was performed, student and class, with 4 individual adjustment variables: gender, socioeconomic and cultural level, year repetition, and school grades, which were used to reflect previous student achievement. The individual level examined time spent, effort made, and the way homework was done. The class level considered frequency of assignment and quantity of homework. Prior knowledge, estimated using school grades, is shown to be the most important predictor of achievement in the study. Its effect is greater than the combined effect of all the other variables studied. Once background factors are controlled, the homework variables with most impact on the test are student autonomy and frequency of homework assignment by teachers. Autonomy when doing homework was shown to be the most important individual-level variable in both mathematics and science, and not effort and or time spent doing homework. The optimum duration of homework was found to be 1 hr a day. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants were 134 ninth graders, randomly assigned to the instruction or no-instruction condition. In both conditions the same multiple Internet sources, varying for authoritativeness and stance, were given for the basic and transfer (about GM food) inquiry tasks. Findings reveal that learners in the instruction condition outperformed the others in both the inquiry task of the instructional context and, more importantly, in the transfer inquiry task. These learners showed more appropriate navigation behavior and greater source evaluation, as well as better surface and deeper comprehension of the accessed information on GM food. In addition, prior knowledge moderated the latter. Theoretical and practical significance of the study is outlined.},

The results, based on 341 student-teachers, indicated that the factor sturucture is consistent with the model. Further analyses indicated that student teacher views differ based on gender, department, class-level. Finally, relationships were found among epistemological beliefs (Innate/Fixed Ability, Learning Effort, Learning Process/Expert Knowledge, Certainty Knowledge) and approaches to teaching and learning (Constructivist Conception, Traditional Conception). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In Study 1 (2,712 students in grades 5, 7, and 9; mean age=13.37 years), lower homework effort was found in higher grades. The effects of intrinsic value on homework effort were higher in the older cohorts, whereas the effects of the expectancy component were lower. In Study 2 (571 students in grades 8 and 9; mean age=14.72), an expanded expectancy-value framework was found to explain both homework and classwork variables. The means for effort and value were lower for homework than for classwork; these differences were partly moderated by students' conscientiousness. The implications of homework behavior and motivation for developmental research are highlighted.},

abstract = {Historically, expectancy-value models of motivation assumed a synergistic relation between expectancy and value: motivation is high only when both expectancy and value are high. Motivational processes were studied from a within-person perspective, with expectancies and values being assessed or experimentally manipulated across multiple domains and the focus being placed on intraindividual differences. In contrast, contemporary expectancy-value models in educational psychology concentrate almost exclusively on linear effects of expectancy and value on motivational outcomes, with a focus on between-person differences. Recent advances in latent variable methodology allow both issues to be addressed in observational studies. Using the expectancy-value model of homework motivation as a theoretical framework, this study estimated multilevel structural equation models with latent interactions in a sample of 511 secondary school students and found synergistic effects between domain-specific homework expectancy and homework value in predicting homework engagement in 6 subjects. This approach not only brings the "x" back into expectancy-value theory but also reestablishes the within-person perspective as the appropriate level of analysis for latent expectancy-value models.

Another section briefly describes identification, latent variable indeterminancy, and other properties common to models with latent variables. The paper then reviews the role of latent variables in multiple regression, probit and logistic regression, factor analysis, latent curve models, item response theory, latent class analysis, and structural equation models. Though these application areas are diverse, the paper highlights the similarities as well as the differences in the manner in which the latent variables are defined and used. It concludes with an evaluation of the different definitions of latent variables and their properties.},

In the first section of this article, we provide a critical and compre- hensive review of these different research programs.

As these issues are addressed in future research, there will be more consensus regard- ing the nature of epistemological theories, and their relation to cognition, motivation, and learning will be made more explicit.},

However, these MLM approaches do not accommodate mediation pathways with Level-2 outcomes and may produce conflated estimates of between- and within-level components of indirect effects. Moreover, these methods have each appeared in isolation, so a unified framework that integrates the existing methods, as well as new multilevel mediation models, is lacking. Here we show that a multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) paradigm can overcome these 2 limitations of mediation analysis with MLM. We present an integrative 2-level MSEM mathematical framework that subsumes new and existing multilevel mediation approaches as special cases. We use several applied examples and accompanying software code to illustrate the flexibility of this framework and to show that different substantive conclusions can be drawn using MSEM versus MLM.},

Multilevel analyses found a positive association between school-average homework time and mathematics achievement in almost all countries, but the size of the association decreased considerably once socioeconomic background and school track were controlled. At the student level, no clear-cut relationship was established between homework time and achievement across the 40 countries.

abstract = {Four epistemological belief and two teaching and learning conception dimensions were identified from a survey study of a sample of Hong Kong teacher education students. The epistemological belief dimensions were labeled Innate/Fixed Ability, Learning Effort/Process, Authority/Expert Knowledge and Certainty Knowledge. The results on epistemological beliefs were somewhat different from Schommer's findings with North American college students and reflected the influence of cultural contexts. The two teaching and learning conceptions were labelled Traditional and Constructivist Conceptions. Pearson correlation analysis showed significant relations between Innate/Fixed Ability, Authority/Expert Knowledge and Certainty Knowledge with Traditional Conception and Learning Effort/Process with Constructivist Conception. Confirmatory factor analysis also showed the possible causal effect of epistemological beliefs on conceptions about teaching and learning. All these analyses tended to support the suggested views in literature that teachers' conceptions about teaching and learning are beliefs driven. Implications were drawn for future research in teacher education with respect to the relation of epistemological beliefs and teaching/learning conceptions in different cultures. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Academic dishonesty (cheating) has been prevalent on college campuses for decades, and the percentage of students reporting cheating varies by college major. This study, based on a survey of 643 undergraduate engineering majors at 11 institutions, used two parallel hierarchical multiple regression analyses to predict the frequency of cheating on exams and the frequency of cheating on homework based on eight blocks of independent variables: demographics, pre-college cheating behavior, co-curricular participation, plus five blocks organized around Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (moral obligation not to cheat, attitudes about cheating, evaluation of the costs and benefits of cheating, perceived social pressures to cheat or not to cheat, and perceived effectiveness of academic dishonesty policies). The final models significantly predict 36{\%} of the variance in "frequency of cheating on exams" and 14{\%} of the variance in 'frequency of cheating on homework". Students don't see cheating as a single construct and their decisions to cheat or not to cheat are influenced differently depending on the type of assessment. Secondary findings are that a student's conviction that cheating is wrong no matter what the circumstances is a strong deterrent to cheating across types of assessment and that a student who agrees that he/ she would cheat in order to alleviate stressful situations is more likely to cheat on both exams and homework.},

A sample of 157 undergraduates responded to questionnaires on prior knowledge and topic-specific epistemological beliefs before they read the seven texts. After reading, participants were given tasks intended to assess surface and deep understanding, as well as intertextual understanding. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses with the text comprehension measures as dependent variables showed that the belief that knowledge consists of highly interrelated concepts positively predicted scores on all three reading tasks. In addition, beliefs about knowledge as tentative and evolving positively predicted intertextual understanding. Finally, beliefs that the knower is an active constructor of meaning negatively predicted deeper understanding of single texts.

The responses of 731 European science students in upper secondary school and undergraduate programmes to two written diagnostic questions are analysed for consistency. The written questions yielded some insights into students' views. There is evidence that the majority of students in this sample draw upon different epistemological representations in different contexts.

Research on the quality of second language teaching has recently highlighted the need to consider not only cross-curricular but also domain-specific dimensions of instructional quality. In this study, theoretical assumptions about domain-specific determinants of interest and performances in second language acquisition are tested, using data from a sample of 1 655 eighth graders in three Swiss cantons: Fribourg, Lucerne, and Valais. Factor analysis yielded five factors related to teaching dimensions of French as an additional language: use of French in lessons, intensity of language use and practice, use of authentic material, vocabulary learning, and communication with native speakers. Subsequent multilevel analyses showed that using French in lessons, as well as intensive language use and practice are significantly associated with the students performances and the interest the develop over a 1-year period. Vocabulary learning has no effect. Contrary to expectations, there is a negative relationship between communicating with French native speakers and the development of interest for learning French as a second language. (DIPF/Orig.)},

This article takes the view that the student teachers' assumptions regarding the concept of theory affect how they engage with theory during initial teacher education. Using a qualitative approach, this study examines student teachers' conceptualizations of the nature and role of theory in teacher education. The results indicate conflicts between student teachers' assumptions about theory in general and pedagogical theories in particular, and also between a narrow conception of the nature of theory and a more nuanced understanding of the purpose of theory. Student teachers' encounter with pedagogy as an academic discipline—with a different epistemology than the one they know from their discipline-specific studies— seems to cause considerable struggle that often ends in a devaluation and denigration of theory in teacher education. The implications of these findings for teacher education are discussed.},

Following this, research addressing the development of interest is overviewed, with particular attention to (a) the triggering of interest in both earlier and later phases of interest, (b) maintaining interest once it has been triggered, (c) fluctuations in interest, and (d) shifts between phases in the development of interest.

Epistemic beliefs were assessed with the Internet-Specific Epistemological Questionnaire (ISEQ) and processing of source information was measured through eye tracking, log files, and verbal protocols. Furthermore, Web users' post-search decisions and their basis for those decisions were assessed. Results from multiple regression analyses indicated that beliefs in the Web as a reliable resource of accurate knowledge and detailed facts were related to decreased verbal reflection on the credibility and type of sources and decreased attention to the URLs of the search results, as well as a greater certainty in the post-search decision. In addition, doubts about the need to check knowledge claims on the Web against other sources, reason, and prior knowledge were related to a more one-sided representation of the conflicting issue. In conclusion, the findings suggested that Internet-specific certainty, source, and structure beliefs primarily play a role in source evaluation, while Internet-specific beliefs about the justification for knowing primarily play a role in constructing a complete representation of document contents. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There is evidence that students' epistemological beliefs impact on approaches to learning and consequent learning outcomes. Epistemological beliefs have been shown to influence students' approaches to study and problem-solving, motivation and persistence in information seeking. There are also some preliminary research findings that suggest the structure of learning environments can influence students' epistemological beliefs. A study was designed to investigate the impacts of a new course on students' epistemological beliefs. The new course structure was based on engaging students in web-supported independent activities prior to small-group workshops that focused on active learning. Findings indicate that students' epistemological beliefs changed during the course implementation, and that students with more complex epistemological beliefs achieved better results in the course.

On the basis of various beliefs frameworks, the authors predicted that individuals' beliefs would vary within a domain across the same content when presented conceptually versus procedurally. Participants were 81 high school students enrolled in an advanced physics course. Students completed a conceptually oriented test and a procedurally oriented test on the same content 1 week apart, and they immediately responded to the Epistemological Beliefs Assessment for Physical Science questionnaire after completion of each test. Results revealed that girls espoused more constructivist beliefs about physics for conceptual knowledge than for procedural knowledge, whereas the opposite was found for boys. Moreover, female students espoused more constructivist beliefs than did male students across both types. These results have important theoretical and methodological implications.

We present an overview of traditional and more contemporary epistemological stances from philosophical perspectives to offer another basis from which to examine this issue. Explicit examples of academic domains are described and epistemological comparisons are made based on our synthesized definition. Given the epistemological similarities and differences across domains that we identified from empirical and philosophical considerations, we propose that beliefs are both domain general and domain specific. Accordingly, we present a theoretical framework of personal epistemology that incorporates both positions and hypothesize how the belief systems might interact in terms of the development of personal epistemology and relations to various facets of cognition, motivation, and achievement.

@article{Open2015,
abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {\textless} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47{\%} of original effect sizes were in the 95{\%} confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39{\%} of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68{\%} with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47{\%} of original effect sizes were in the 95{\%} confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39{\%} of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68{\%} with statistically significant effects.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the types of, and degrees to which, a sample of teachers in Arizona were aware of, or had themselves engaged in test-related cheating practices as a function of the high-stakes testing policies of No Child Left Behind. A near census sample of teachers was surveyed, with valid responses obtained from about 5 percent, totaling just over 3,000 teachers. In addition, one small convenience sample of teachers was interviewed, and another participated in a focus group. Data revealed that cheating occurs and that educators can be quite clever when doing so. But how one defines cheating makes it difficult to quantify the frequency with which educators engage in such practices. Our analysis thus required us to think about a taxonomy of cheating based on the definitions of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree offenses in the field of law. These categories were analyzed to help educators better define, and be more aware of others' and their own cheating practices, in an attempt to inform local testing policies and procedures.

abstract = {Latent growth modeling has been a topic of intense interest during the past two decades. Most theoretical and applied work has employed first-order growth models, in which a single manifest variable serves as indicator of trait level at each time of measurement. In the current paper, we concentrate on issues regarding second-order growth models, which have multiple indicators at each time of measurement. With multiple indicators, tests of factorial invariance of parameters across times of measurement can be tested. We conduct such tests using two sets of data, which differ in the extent to which factorial invariance holds, and evaluate longitudinal confirmatory factor, latent growth curve, and latent difference score models. We demonstrate that, if factorial invariance fails to hold, choice of indicator used to identify the latent variable can have substantial influences on the characterization of patterns of growth, strong enough to alter conclusions about growth. We also discuss matters related to the scaling of growth factors and conclude with recommendations for practice and for future research.},

abstract = {Data in social and behavioral sciences are often hierarchically organized. Multilevel statistical procedures have been developed to analyze such data while taking into account the dependence of observations. When simultaneously evaluating models at all levels, a significant statistic provides no information on the level at which the model is misspecified. Model misspecification can exist at one or several levels simultaneously. When one level is misspecified, the other levels may be affected even when they are correctly specified. Motivated by these observations, we propose to separate a multilevel covariance structure into multiple single-level covariance structure models and to fit these single-level models as in conventional covariance structure analysis. A procedure for segregating the multilevel model into single-level models is developed. Five test statistics for evaluating a model at each level are provided. Standard error formulas for the separate estimators are also provided, and their efficiency is compared to simultaneous estimators. Empirical and Monte Carlo results demonstrate the advantages of the segregated procedure over the simultaneous procedure. Computer programs that will allow the developed procedure to be used in practice are also presented.},

abstract = {{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}Preface This book has its genesis in my PhD research at the London School of Economics. I started the degree with questions about the 2008/09 financial crisis and planned to spend most of my time researching about capital adequacy requirements. But I quickly realized much of my time would actually be spent learning the day-to-day tasks of data gathering, analysis, and results presentation. After plodding through for awhile, the breaking point came while reentering results into a regression table after I had tweaked one of my statistical models, yet again. Surely there was a better way to do research that would allow me to spend more time answering my research questions. Making research reproducible for others also means making it better organized and efficient for yourself. So, my search for a better way led me straight to the tools for reproducible computational research. The reproducible research community is very active, knowledgeable and helpful. Nonetheless, I often encountered holes in this collective knowledge, or at least had no resource to bring it all together as a whole. That is my intention for this book: to bring together the skills I have picked up for actually doing and presenting computational research. Hopefully, the book along with making reproducible research more common, will save researchers hours of Googling, so they can spend more time addressing their research questions. I would not have been able to write this book without many people's advice and support. Foremost is John Kimmel, acquisitions editor at Chapman {\{}{\&}{\}} Hall. He approached me with in Spring 2012 with the general idea and opportunity for this book{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}--},

abstract = {Whilst many definitions of formative assessment have been offered, there is no clear rationale to define and delimit it within broader theories of pedagogy. This paper aims to offer such a rationale, within a framework which can also unify the diverse set of practices which have been described as formative. The analysis is used to relate formative assessment both to other pedagogic initiatives, notably cognitive acceleration and dynamic assessment, and to some of the existing literature on models of self-regulated learning and on classroom discourse. This framework should indicate potentially fruitful lines for further enquiry, whilst at the same time opening up new ways of helping teachers to implement formative practices more effectively.},

abstract = {In many observational studies, analysts estimate treatment effects using propensity scores, e.g. by matching or sub-classifying on the scores. When some values of the covariates are missing, analysts can use multiple imputation to fill in the missing data, estimate propensity scores based on the m completed datasets, and use the propensity scores to estimate treatment effects. We compare two approaches to implement this process. In the first, the analyst estimates the treatment effect using propensity score matching within each completed data set, and averages the m treatment effect estimates. In the second approach, the analyst averages the m propensity scores for each record across the completed datasets, and performs propensity score matching with these averaged scores to estimate the treatment effect. We compare properties of both methods via simulation studies using artificial and real data. The simulations suggest that the second method has greater potential to produce substantial bias reductions than the first, particularly when the missing values are predictive of treatment assignment.},

At the beginning and the end of the school year teachers' beliefs about (1) the nature of mathematics (i.e., procedures to solve problems versus a tool for thought), (2) mathematics learning (i.e., focusing on getting correct solutions versus understanding mathematical concepts), (3) who should control students' mathematical activity, (4) the nature of mathematical ability (i.e., fixed versus malleable), and (5) the value of extrinsic rewards for getting students to engage in mathematics activities were assessed. (6) Teachers self-confidence and enjoyment of mathematics and mathematics teaching were also assessed. Analyses were conducted to assess the coherence among these beliefs and associations between teachers' beliefs and their observed classroom practices and self-reported evaluation criteria. Findings showed substantial coherence among teachers' beliefs and consistent associations between their beliefs and their practices.

abstract = {Missing values have always been a serious problem in psychological research. In the presence of missing values, a researcher has three goals, and these goals provide the standard for evaluating alternative strategies: 1. Maximize the information used in the analysis; 2. Minimize the bias in estimating model parameters; and 3. Minimize the bias in estimating standard errors by correctly reflecting the degree of uncertainty associated with parameter estimates. In this chapter, I review some traditional ways of handling missing values that yield unbiased estimates of the parameters and seriously underestimate the uncertainty of these estimates. The standard errors will be too small, and this results in erroneous statistical significance, that is, a Type 2 error. Unbiased estimates of the standard error must reflect two key elements: (a) the gain in certainty that is obtained by using all available information, and (b) the loss in certainty obtained depending on how missing values are handled.

abstract = {Behavioral science researchers routinely use scale scores that sum or average a set of questionnaire items to address their substantive questions. A researcher applying multiple imputation to incomplete questionnaire data can either impute the incomplete items prior to computing scale scores or impute the scale scores directly from other scale scores. This study used a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the impact of imputation method on the bias and efficiency of scale-level parameter estimates, including scale score means, between-scale correlations, and regression coefficients. Although the choice of imputation approach had no influence on the bias of scale-level parameter estimates, it had a substantial impact on efficiency, such that item-level imputation consistently produced a meaningful power advantage. The simulation results clearly supported the use of item-level imputation. To illustrate the differences between item- and scale-level imputation, we examined predictors of 7th-grade academic self-efficacy in a sample of 595 low-income Mexican Origin adolescents in a planned missingness design. The results of the empirical data analysis were consistent with those of the simulation and also suggested that researchers should be cautious when implementing planned missing data designs that necessitate scale-level imputation.},

He gathers evidence about the kind of research that is most likely to bridge the teaching-research gap, arguing that such research must provide continuous, detailed data on the experience of individual students, in-depth analyses of the changes that take place in the students' knowledge, beliefs, and skills, and ways of identifying the real-time interactive relationships between these two different kinds of data. Based on his exploration of the literature and his research on teaching effectiveness, Nuthall proposes an explanatory theory for research on teaching that can be directly and trans- parently linked to classroom realities.},

In Study 1, the two tests were translated and applied to a Spanish-speaking sample. A detailed dimensionality exploration, by means of the monotone homogeneity model and confirmatory factor analysis, provides unexpected dimensionality results. Therefore, a new test is proposed, and the dimensionality and psychometric properties of the test's scores are determined. The new test retains four of the five original dimensions. The EQEBI has 27 items, and its score reliability is higher than that of the original EQ and EBI. In Study 2, the EQEBI was applied to another sample to verify the psychometric properties of the obtained scores. The expected four unidimensional scales are confirmed. The scales are calibrated with the graded response model. Recommendations are offered for using the scales for epistemological beliefs assessment.

Strongly gender-identified women showed significantly greater liking for feminine occupations in the stereotype-activation condition than in the control condition. However, more weakly identified women did not show the same effect. In contrast, women weak in gender identification reported an increase in perceived ability for feminine occupations when stereotypes were activated than in the control condition. Activating gender stereotypes did not shift reported liking or perceived ability in traditionally masculine occupations. These results demonstrate the theoretical and practical importance of gender stereotypes on women's career-related attitudes.},

abstract = {In conventional structural equation models, all latent variables and indicators vary between units (typically subjects) and are assumed to be independent across units. The latter assumption is violated in multilevel settings where units are nested in clusters, leading to within-cluster de- pendence. Different approaches to extending structural equation models for such multilevel settings are examined. The most common approach is to formulate separate within-cluster and between-cluster models. An advantage of this set-up is that it allows software for conventional struc- tural equation models to be ‘tricked' into estimating the model. However, the standard implementation of this approach does not permit cross-level paths from latent or observed variables at a higher level to latent or ob- served variables at a lower level, and does not allow for indicators varying at higher levels. A multilevel regression (or path) model formulation is therefore suggested in which some of the response variables and some of the explanatory variables at the different levels are latent and measured by multiple indicators. The Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Modeling (GLLAMM) framework allows such models to be specified by simply letting the usual model for the structural part of a structural equation model include latent and observed variables varying at different levels. Models of this kind are applied to the U.S. sample of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000 to investigate the relation- ship between the school-level latent variable ‘teacher excellence' and the student-level latent variable ‘reading ability', each measured by multiple ordinal indicators.},

In this study, we focused on the need for cognition (NFC; Cacioppo, J.T. and Petty, R.E., 1982. The need for cognition. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42, 116--131) and examined the implications of this personality variable relative to smartphone use. The results based on the survey data (N = 411) provided support for our hypotheses that NFC is an important motivational personality construct that distinguishes between adopters and non-adopters of smartphones. We also found that NFC moderates the linkages between instrumental beliefs, social influence factors, and behavioural intentions (BI). Specifically, perceived usefulness had a stronger effect on BI for high-NFC people, whereas perceived ease of use and subjective norms had stronger effects for low-NFC people. The findings reveal possible important variations in technology adoption and the role of NFC in governing these alternative decision-making processes. Implications for theory, product design, as well as for managers are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Our aim here is not to review the theories. Extensive reviews of motivational theories, their assumptions, and their applications to educational practice can be found in other excellent sources. Rather, for the purpose of this chapter, we highlight how assumptions that underlie contemporary motivational perspectives guide both theoretical explanations of motivational phenomena and the approach to and principles for applying these theoretical understandings to practice. We follow this discussion by pointing to epistemological assumptions about motivation and educational research shared by several of the currently dominant motivational theories and by listing theoretical, methodological, practical, and ethical challenges to these assumptions that can undermine the application of these motivational theories in educational settings. Finally, we end by suggesting possible directions for addressing these challenges and for developing general principles for conceptualizing, investigating, and applying motivational theory in educational practice.

abstract = {Lives and livelihoods in the Rural South are becoming increasingly divorced from farming and, therefore, from the land. Patterns and associations of wealth and poverty have become more diffuse and diverse as non-farm opportunities have expanded and heightened levels of mobility have led to the delocalization of livelihoods. This, in turn, has had ramifications for the production and reproduction of poverty in the countryside, which is becoming progressively de-linked from agricultural resources. This requires a reconsideration of some old questions regarding how best to achieve pro-poor development in the Rural South.},

abstract = {How do epistemological attitudes and beliefs influence learning from text? We conceptualize epistemological attitudes and beliefs as components of metacognitive knowledge. As such, they serve an important function in regulating the use of epistemic strategies such as knowledge-based validation of information and checking arguments for internal consistency. We report results from two studies that investigated the effects epistemological attitudes and beliefs on the use of epistemic strategies in academic learning and the motivational states that mediate these effects. Study 1 (N = 289) tested a mediation model with epistemological attitudes (separate vs. connected knowing) and textual characteristics as distal predictors, and learning goals (learning factual knowledge vs. developing an own standpoint) as mediator variables. Separate knowing had large indirect effects on the use of epistemic strategies via the goal to develop an own point of view. In addition, learners adapted their learning goals and epistemic strategies depending on objective characteristics and the perceived familiarity of the texts they read. In Study 2 (N = 124), epistemological beliefs concerning the uncertainty of knowledge increased the use of epistemic strategies only when extrinsic study motivation was low. A mediated moderation model established this effect to be mediated by specific epistemic curiosity. These results illuminate the mechanisms of how epistemological attitudes and beliefs affect self-regulated learning. In contrast to other types of learning strategies, the use of epistemic strategies seems to be strongly and consistently linked to epistemological attitudes and beliefs.},

abstract = {Recent research has shown that learning from worked-out examples is of major importance for initial skill acquisition in well-structured domains such as mathematics. However, only those learners who actively process the presented examples profit noticeably from this learning mode. Specifically, the learning outcomes depend on how well the learners explain the solution steps presented in the examples to themselves (‘self-explanation effect”). In a series of studies on learning mathematics from examples, learners' spontaneous self-explanations and instructional means used to encourage self-explanations were investigated. In this research, the following main findings were obtained. Most learners were rather passive with respect to their spontaneous self-explanations. Among the active and successful learners, two subgroups employing different self-explanation styles could be identified. With regard to the instructional means used to induce effective example processing, it turned out that to employ “learning by teaching” in order to stimulate explanation activities was of very limited use. Attempts to directly train for or elicit certain types of self-explanations were more successful. However, even in the latter case, self-explanations had inherent deficits (e.g., proneness to errors). Thus, we sought to design learning arrangements that try to integrate self-explanations with well-timed and well-adapted instructional explanations (e.g., from tutors) in order to enhance students' problem-solving skills.},

A questionnaire survey of 780 primary and secondary school teachers (53.5{\{}{\%}{\}} response rate; mean age 38.1 yrs) was used. In stepwise multiple regression, social support at work and the coping responses behavioral disengagement and suppression of competing activities predicted job stress independently of age, gender, class size, occupational grade and negative affectivity. High job stress was associated with low social support at work and greater use of coping by disengagement and suppression of competing activities. It is suggested that behavioral disengagement and suppression of competing activities are maladaptive responses in a teaching environment and may actually contribute to job stress. Coping and social support not only moderate the impact of stressors on well-being but influence the appraisal of environmental demands as stressful.

This qualitative, exploratory case study focuses on the epistemology of instructional practices as interpreted by students in two versions of introductory-level college chemistry, each with different underlying epistemological assumptions. Classroom observations and interviews of 25 first-year students provide a contextualized perspective on the dimensionality of beliefs as identified in the literature: certainty of knowledge, simplicity of knowledge, source of knowledge, and justification for knowing. This research suggests that students' perceptions of instructional practices are interpreted through the lens of their epistemological assumptions, but that such perspectives are evolving and instructors may influence them in multiple ways. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, we focus on epistemic beliefs and on the changes that a view of knowing as a complex, effortful, generative, evi- dence-seeking, and reflective enterprise entails. In this context, we discuss how familiarity with the processes used to justify knowledge claims within specific disciplinary communities can provide useful tools to develop the kind of adaptive and consistent thinking that characterize competence in different domains and how this focus may aid the identification of characteristics common across domains. We use our empirical exploration of adolescents' development of competence in the domain of history to illustrate the implications of this theoreti- cal framework, to highlight the relations between domain-specific epistemic beliefs and kind of understanding that students built as a result of reading multiple texts, and to suggest what pedagogical practices may have influenced students' orientations toward knowing in these three history classes.},

abstract = {Research on epistemological beliefs has clearly increased in the last decade. Even though the construct is clearer and relevant data are being collected, there are important theoretical and methodological issues that need further clarification. One of them is the debate about the domain generality-specificity of epistemological beliefs. I argue that there are both theoretical and methodological difficulties that hinder a more fruitful approach of the domain generality-specificity debate. Differences in goals and scope of the diverse conceptualizations about epistemological beliefs and how they devise the role of content-domain and context are a major source of difficulties. Methodological problems such as whether such epistemological beliefs can be measured "in isolation"-free of content and context influence-or the impossibility of collecting direct measures of epistemological beliefs may influence how the domain generality-specificity question is approached. Some suggestions about how these difficulties may be overcome are developed. The relevance of exploring epistemological beliefs across domains and across contexts is emphasized. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The questionnaire contains four scales: one general academic self-concept scale (absolute) and three reference-norm based self-concept scales (criterion-referenced, social-referenced, individual-referenced). The sample comprised 907 German high school students (grades 7-10). The psychometric properties of the four scales are equivalent to those reported by Sch{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}ne et al (2002). Factor analyses of the reference-norm based items yield only two factors, not in accordance with the postulated dimensional structure. One component is made up by the individual reference-norm based items, the other by all remaining items. There is no evidence for differential relations of the four self-concept scales to various facets of test anxiety, to six subject-specific academic self-concept scales, to grades, to interests in six school subjects and to a global measure of academic self-concept.

Our longitudinal data indicate that children's numerical processing skills at primary school entrance were predictively related to their future competence in single-digit arithmetic and their reliance on arithmetic fact retrieval. This association was not explained by children's intellectual ability, preschool mathematical abilities, verbal working memory, visual-spatial short-term memory and processing speed.

Specifically, we manipulated the representation of physics concepts in texts about Newtonian mechanics and explored how these texts interacted with individuals' epistemic beliefs to facilitate or constrain learning. Results revealed that when individuals' epistemic beliefs were consistent with the knowledge representations in their assigned texts, they performed better on various measures of learning (use of processing strategies, text recall, and changes in misconceptions) than when their epistemic beliefs were inconsistent with the knowledge representations. These results have implications for how researchers conceptualize epistemic beliefs and support contemporary views regarding the context sensitivity of individuals' epistemic beliefs.

abstract = {For more than two decades, three components of teacher knowledge have been discussed, namely, content knowledge (CK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and general pedagogical knowledge (GPK). Although there is a growing body of analytic clarification and empirical testing with regard to CK and PCK, especially with a focus on mathematics teachers, hardly any attempt has been made to learn more about teachers' GPK. In the context of the Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M), Germany, Taiwan, and the United States worked on closing this research gap by conceptualizing a theoretical framework and developing a standardized test of GPK, which was taken by representative samples of future middle school teachers in these countries. Four task-based subdimensions of GPK and three cognitive subdimensions of GPK were distinguished in this test. TEDS-M data are used (a) to test the hypothesis that GPK is not homogenous but multidimensional and (b) to compare the achievement of U.S. future middle school teachers with future middle school teachers from Germany and Taiwan. The data revealed that U.S. future teachers were outperformed by both the other groups. They showed a relative strength in one of the cognitive subdimensions, generating strategies to perform in the classroom, indicating that in particular they had acquired procedural GPK during teacher education.},

The results indicated that the pre-service teachers' beliefs about good teaching evolved from a belief in being in control through expertise to a belief in being in control through charisma and building relationship with their students. The first teaching practicum experience dramatically challenged the beliefs of these students where the beliefs indicated immediately after the experience to be more focussed on 'self' rather than students. Subsequent belief structures differed in character from both those after the first teaching experience and from those held prior to the first teaching responsibility. The study also reports on the pre-service students' self-efficacy beliefs in good teaching. Gender differences are also discussed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {* The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. * The presentation of ‘variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. * One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). * Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. * This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

abstract = {This paper implemented a comparative approach to investigate the relationships between test-based school accountability policies in 2 German states and teachers' acceptance and usage of feedback information. Thuringia implemented mandatory tests for secondary schools based on competency modeling and performance data controlled for socioeconomic variables. In comparison to Thuringia, mandatory testing in Baden-Wurttemberg is rather simple, not based on competency modeling and performance feedback is not controlled for socio- economic variables. Drawing on a model of quality features of school performance feedback systems, it was hypothesized that mandatory testing in Thuringia leads to higher teacher evaluation of mandatory testing and usefulness of performance feedback. Analysis of quantitative survey data for math teachers (n ¼ 357) showed that teachers in Thuringia rather accept mandatory testing and describe performance feedback information as more useful for educational diagnosis, student tutoring, and repetition. The paper finally discusses to what extent the observed differences can be attributed to the respective testing system.},

Results suggest that sitting in a particular row of the classroom does influence learning performance, and this relationship is moderated by the individuals' levels of shyness, but not of nonconformity.

This article addresesses how these 5 aspects of Paul's thinking influenced work in the area of personal epistemology, a construct that encompasses individuals' conceptions of knowledge and knowing. In addition, the article provides examples of progress made by multiple researchers on the earlier challenges identified for the field (Hofer {\&} Pintrich, 1997; Pintrich, 2002), reflects on the areas that need resolution for this particular field to advance, and identifies new challenges and directions that have emerged.},

Six themes related to the source of teaching knowledge emerged: formal education, formalized bodies of knowledge, observational learning, collaboration with others, enactive experiences, and self-reflection. For beliefs about the stabil- ity of teaching knowledge, individuals expressed beliefs about the amount, direction, and quality of knowledge change with regard to various aspects of knowledge (e.g., content knowledge, use and integration of technology, knowledge of development and pedagogy).

First, we seek to make theorists and researchers aware of the importance of not using the terms moderator and mediator interchangeably by carefully elaborating, both conceptually and strategically, the many ways in which moderators and mediators differ. We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, including control and stress, attitudes, and personality traits. We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators.

Confirmatory factor analysis was used to compare 3 different models of the QRI and to investigate the invariance of the factor structure of the QRI across gender and across relationship satisfaction. Analyses revealed that a 3-factor solution--consisting of 3 different but interrelated factors (a 7-item support factor, a 12-item conflict factor, and a 6-item depth factor)--best accounted for the data. The authors' findings suggest that full metric invariance holds across gender and across relationship satisfaction in the female subsample, whereas only partial metric invariance could be established for relationship satisfaction in the male subsample.},

Constructivist Learning Environment Survey, Scientific Epistemological Beliefs, and Learning Approach Questionnaire were administered to 1152 Turkish eight grade elementary school students to measure constructivist learning environment perceptions, scientific epistemological beliefs, and learning approach, respectively. Path analysis supported the model in general, although not all proposed paths were significant.

The relationship between fixed beliefs and learning approach was not significant. Fixed beliefs were significantly related only with personal relevance variable.

abstract = {Epistemological beliefs are an important aspect of current psychological thinking. Personal epistemological development and epistemological beliefs involve: how individuals come to know, the theories and beliefs they hold about knowing, and the manner in which such epistemological premises are a part of and an influence on the cognitive processes of thinking and reasoning (Hofer and Pintrich, 1997, p. 88). In the classroom, students are exposed to new ideas, theories, and information from different sources every day. Students' beliefs about knowledge and knowing influence the way they perceive and respond to the learning situations they encounter. For example, as students study an historical event such as the US Civil War, they may have the opportunity to examine different sources of information such as a textbook that describes the war, personal letters written by soldiers, and/or analyses of the war published by history experts. The views of the students and other aspects of the epistemic climate (Bendixen and Rule, 2004) of their learning environment influence how these students will proceed. For instance, learners may be passive or active in this process, they may be asked to weigh evidence about these different historical sources and make their own warranted judgments, or they may be expected to find the one correct version of what happened and not question it. In addition, students may think that historical information is more relative and open to interpretation while a subject such as mathematics leaves very little room for student interpretation.

abstract = {Individuals' beliefs about knowledge (i.e., epistemological beliefs) have be- come the focus of inquiry in the educational and psychological literatures. Based on an analysis of those literatures, we first propose that epistemologi- cal beliefs are multidimensional and multilayered. That is, individuals possess general beliefs about knowledge, as well as beliefs about more specific forms of knowledge (e.g., academic knowledge). Second, we examine the relationship between epistemological beliefs and learning in order to understand why such beliefs are important to educators. Third, we question whether beliefs about academic knowledge are truly general (i.e., unwavering across academic do- mains) or have a character reflective of the domain to which they are associated (i.e., domain specific). Finally, we explore some of the common problems in the research and suggest topics for future study.},

abstract = {Rater bias is a substantial source of error in psychological research. Bias distorts observed effect sizes beyond the expected level of attenuation due to intrarater error, and the impact of bias is not accurately estimated using conventional methods of correction for attenuation. Using a model based on multivariate generalizability theory, this article illustrates how bias affects research results. The model identifies 4 types of bias that may affect findings in research using observer ratings, including the biases traditionally termed leniency and halo errors. The impact of bias depends on which of 4 classes of rating design is used, and formulas are derived for correcting observed effect sizes for attenuation (due to bias variance) and inflation (due to bias covariance) in each of these classes. The rater bias model suggests procedures for researchers seeking to minimize adverse impact of bias on study findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Our goal in developing this model is to integrate many of the salient theoretical issues raised by the diverse models of personal epistemology represented in this special issue as a way to guide and inform future research and educational practice.},

Changes in efficacy that these memories induced were not restricted to the romantic domain but were also seen on interpersonal, athletic, and other activities remote from romance. Results suggest that emotional states have widespread impact on judgments by making mood-congruent thoughts more available.

The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range ofmodels under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

In line with our hypothesis, students high on certainty beliefs showed lower school achievement at Time 1, even when controlling for indicators of intelligence and family background. Certainty beliefs also predicted the choice of future fields of study at college (self-selection hypothesis) and were shaped by enrolment in specific fields of study at college (socialization hypothesis). {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Based on this conceptual analysis I argue for two extensions of this construct: In addition to traditional applications, the methodology should be transferred to also measure calibration between students' metacognitive control processes (traditionally, only students' metacognitive judgments were considered) and important external criteria (traditionally, judgments were only compared to students' own performance). As an illustrative example, one application context will be highlighted where these proposed extensions would alleviate potential problems with the traditional conceptualization: While students' idiosyncratic task definitions constitute unwanted error variance in the traditional account it would be possible to investigate them as a primary research question within this extended notion. More specifically, it would be possible to investigate how well students' learning processes match objective task demands. I will put forward theoretical and empirical arguments in favor of these suggestions.},

abstract = {The Internet is a convenient source of information about science-based topics (e.g., health matters). Whereas experts are familiar with the conventions of “true” scientific discourse and the assessment of scientific information, laypeople may have great difficulty choosing among, evaluating, and deciding on the vast amount of information available online on the basis of their fragmentary understanding of science. The evaluation of science-based text informationmay require an (at least rudimentary) understanding of the norms of scientific discourse. Two studies investigated whether laypeople have an adequate grasp of what makes a text scientific and whether their perceptions of text “scientificness” contribute to their evaluation of the credibility of online text information. Furthermore, we investigated whether laypeople distinguish between their own judgments of science-based information and those they expect experts to make, indicating a divergence between their understanding of “official science” and their personal beliefs.},

@article{Allan2007,
abstract = {The connotations of a language expression are pragmatic effects that arise from encyclopaedic knowledge about its denotation (or reference) and also from experiences, beliefs, and prejudices about the contexts in which the expression is typically used. The connotation of a language expression is clearly distinct from its sense, denotation and reference. For example, Mike and Michael can have the same reference but different connotations. John is an unsuitable name for your new-born daughter; so is Springtime in Paris an inappropriate name for a 1200cc Harley-Davidson motorbike or an auto-repair shop. Identifying the connotations of a term is to identify the community attitude towards it. For instance the connotations of English octopus and the Japanese translation equivalent tako are very different: an octopus is a sinister, alien creature; tako is edible and endearing. Connotation is intimately involved with notions of appropriateness in language use; i.e. with pragmatic effect. For instance, racist dysphemisms occur when a speaker refers to or implicates the hearer or some third person's race, ethnicity, or nationality in such terms as to cause a face affront. Many such 'racist' terms can be disarmed by being used, without irony, as in-group solidarity markers by the targeted group; e.g. the use of nigger/nigga among African Americans. The negative connotations of some existing word often lead to its replacement. Although Jesus Christ! is blasphemous; Gee whiz and By jingo are not. From a purely rational viewpoint, if one of these is blasphemous, then all of them are. But the pragmatic effects, i.e. connotations are different. Connotation is a thoroughly pragmatic category of meaning. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is used routinely in the development and validation of assessment instruments. One of the most significant challenges when one is performing EFA is determining how many factors to retain. Parallel analysis (PA) is an effective stopping rule that compares the eigenvalues of randomly generated data with those for the actual data. PA takes into account sampling error, and at present it is widely considered the best available method. We introduce a variant of PA that goes even further by reproducing the observed correlation matrix rather than generating random data. Comparison data (CD) with known factorial structure are first generated using 1 factor, and then the number of factors is increased until the reproduction of the observed eigenvalues fails to improve significantly. We evaluated the performance of PA, CD with known factorial structure, and 7 other techniques in a simulation study spanning a wide range of challenging data conditions. In terms of accuracy and robustness across data conditions, the CD technique outperformed all other methods, including a nontrivial superiority to PA. We provide program code to implement the CD technique, which requires no more specialized knowledge or skills than performing PA.},

abstract = {As the use of web-based homework delivery and checking systems expands, we have greater need to evaluate how students engage with these systems and how changes in the systems influence student behavior. Reported here is the assessment of WeBWorK, an open-source web-based homework program used largely in postsecondary math and science courses, with recent extension to high school courses. WeBWorK draws from a large library of problems to generate individual assignments and provides immediate feedback about correctness of students' answers. WeBWorK allows entries in multiple choice, formula and numerical formats. The entries recorded by the system create an extensive database of student interactions with the system. In our two-part study, we (1) review 2387 student surveys about WeBWorK in three semesters across a range of mathematics courses and (2) test a model designed to classify student responses to system feedback, permitting a fine-grained analysis of the system's records at the keystroke level for a cohort of 96 Calculus I students. Based on this data, our goals are, first, to understand how students use the system and respond to its feedback; second, to analyze the impact of upgrades to the system interface on student users, and third, to evaluate the efficiency of training raters to classify student records. We find that the introduction of new features to the WeBWorK interface (improvements generated by our initial assessment) were welcomed by most students and reduced the overall number of submitted errors by half by the third year of the study. Importantly, the interface improvements reduced the number of errors that were not pedagogically useful. We also find that our error classification model, called here the Student Response Model, was a good fit for our student sample, as reflected by inter-rater reliability of three raters who coded the student records. In sum, our error classification model appears to be useful for analyzing formula entries. To make this assessment model widely available, we designed a system of exercises to train raters to classify student response files for WeBWorK and similar web-based systems. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Computer-assisted formative assessments with multiple-tier items are a valid instrument for diagnosing students' conceptual understanding in learning domains with well-structured declarative knowledge (e.g. science education). However, it is unknown how feedback on multiple-tier items can improve learning success. Therefore, we assessed (1) predictors of students' perception and use of elaborated feedback, and (2) if feedback content (elaborated, verification, control) matters in explaining students' achievement in post- and retention tests. We developed computer-assisted formative tests for a teaching unit on evolutionary adaptations. Three treatment groups were employed with varying feedback content: Treatment 1 (T1) was an elaborated instruction-based feedback, T2 was a dichotomous verification feedback, and T3 (control) consisted of reading appropriate texts (no formative assessment and no feedback). Afterwards, T1 was separated into one subgroup with pupils who used the feedback thoroughly (T1A) and a subgroup that did not use the feedback (T1B). Ten secondary classrooms were used and 261 pupils participated in this study. Each student in each classroom was randomly assigned to one treatment group. Correlation and univariate regression analysis showed that perception and use of elaborated feedback were related to intrinsic motivation and self-reported grades. Multivariate analysis of covariance was applied to check treatment effects on post-tests and retention tests as dependent variables. Results revealed that verification feedback (T2) and elaborated feedback when students did use it (T1A) was superior to no feedback (T3) and elaborated feedback when students did not use it (T1B). Implications for the design of multiple-tier diagnostic assessments are discussed.},

The questionnaire responses gathered from 377 high school students in Taiwan were utilized to elicit such relationships. The analysis of the structural equation model revealed that students' absolutist scientific epistemic beliefs led to lower-level conceptions of learning science (i.e. learning science as memorizing, preparing for tests, calculating, and practicing) while sophisticated scientific epistemic beliefs might trigger higher-level conceptions of learning science (i.e. learning science as increase of knowledge, applying, and attaining understanding). The students' lower-level conceptions of learning science were also found to negatively associate with their self-efficacy of learning science, while the higher-level conceptions of learning science fostered students' self-efficacy. However, this study found that students who viewed scientific knowledge as uncertain (advanced epistemic belief) tended to possess lower self-efficacy toward learning science.},

abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.

All of these comments suggest ways in which my presentation could be extended or improved; I generally agree with their suggestions, so my re- sponse to their comments is brief. In the second section, Iwill respond to suggestions by Newton and Sireci that my framework be simplified by employing only one kind of argument, a validity argument, and dropping the interpretation/use argument (IUA); I am sympathetic to their desire for greater simplicity, but I see considerable value in keeping the IUA as a framework for the validation effort and will argue for keep- ing both the IUA and the validity argument. In the third section, I will respond to Borsboom and Markus, who raise a fundamental objection to my approach to val- idation, suggesting that I give too much attention to justification and too little to truth as a criterion for validity; I don't accept their proposed conception of validity, and I will indicate why.},

abstract = {Epistemological beliefs, or beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing, are currently a target of increased research interest. The present study examined two research questions: (1) how do epistemological beliefs change over time? and (2) what role do gender, ethnicity, SES, and achievement play in their development? The study was correlational with an ethnically diverse sample of 187 fifth grade students (46{\%} Latino, 27{\%} Anglo, and 27{\%} African American, and 67{\%} low SES). Self-report questionnaires that tapped four dimensions of beliefs (source, certainty, development, and justification) were given to students at two time points during the course of a nine-week science unit. Results showed that students became more sophisticated in their beliefs about source and certainty of knowledge over time, but that there were no reliable changes in development and justification. There also were no main or moderating effects of gender or ethnicity, but there were main effects of SES and achievement. Low SES and low achieving children had less sophisticated beliefs in comparison to average SES and high achieving children. There were no significant interactions between gender, ethnicity, SES, and achievement for any of the four belief measures. Results are discussed in terms of personal and contextual factors and their role in the facilitation of epistemological belief development.},

abstract = {The replication of important findings by multiple independent investigators is fundamental to the accumulation of scientific evidence. Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is "reproducibility," which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health.},

Nevertheless, schools may struggle with these mandates because student data are often stored in forms that are difficult to access, manipulate, and interpret. Such access barriers additionally preclude the use of data at the classroom level to inform and impact instruction. Fortunately, there are newly available computer technologies that allow efficient organization and access to student data. In addition to allowing easier accountability reporting, these tools allow user-friendly data access at all educational levels, meaning that teachers can use these tools to engage in the informed reflection necessary to improve classroom practice. In this article, I discuss teacher use of these systems, providing insight into the function of these tools and discussing conditions that make these tools of the most service to teachers.},

Epistemological beliefs are those personally held beliefs about the nature and structure of knowing. The students were interviewed in relation to their epistemological beliefs at the beginning (Time 1) and conclusion (Time 2) of the teaching program. The results of the qualitative data analysis indicated that students described more sophisticated relational epistemological beliefs over time. This finding is important given that teachers with relativistic epistemological beliefs are more likely to conceive of teaching as a transformative (constructivist) rather than transmissive. The perceived success of the teaching program has implications for the development of a relational teaching model in teacher education courses.},

abstract = {Background: Although extensive research has examined epistemological beliefs, reflective thinking and learning approaches, very few studies have looked at these three theoretical frameworks in their totality. Aims: This research tested two separate structural models of epistemological beliefs, learning approaches, reflective thinking and academic performance among tertiary students over a period of 12 months. Sample: Participants were first-year Arts (N = 616; 271 females, 345 males) and second-year Mathematics (N = 581; 241 females, 341 males) university students. Method: Students' epistemological beliefs were measured with the Schommer epistemological questionnaire (EQ, Schommer, 1990). Reflective thinking was measured with the reflective thinking questionnaire (RTQ, Kember et al., 2000). Student learning approaches were measured with the revised study process questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F, Biggs, Kember, {\{}{\&}{\}} Leung, 2001). LISREL 8 was used to test two structural equation models - the cross-lag model and the causal-mediating model. Results: In the cross-lag model involving Arts students, structural equation modelling showed that epistemological beliefs influenced student learning approaches rather than the contrary. In the causal-mediating model involving Mathematics students, the results indicate that both epistemological beliefs and learning approaches predicted reflective thinking and academic performance. Furthermore, learning approaches mediated the effect of epistemological beliefs on reflective thinking and academic performance. Results of this study are significant as they integrated the three theoretical frameworks within the one study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

This study investigated the question, How do preservice teachers approach their learning in a unified teacher education program?

By understanding these beliefs, teacher educators may be able to improve instruction and learning in teacher education.},

Whether, for whom and which kind of job related treatment can be helpful for teachers returning to work can only be discussed if the specific stress and the social situation of teachers as public officials are taken into consideration. This article examines a systematic evaluation of 63 teachers (mean age 50 yrs) with psychosomatic disorders consecutively admitted in a psychosomatic hospital. Most suffered from depression or/and tinnitus. Most Ss rated job related stress as influencing their symptomatologies. A program focusing on discrepancies between personal ideals versus real situations in school, problems in social interactions and time management, should prove a valuable part of the teachers' psychosomatic inpatient treatment.

abstract = {We propose an integration of aspects of several developmental and systems of beliefs models of personal epistemology. Qualitatively different positions, including realism, dogmatism, skepticism, and rationalism, are characterized according to individuals' beliefs across three dimensions in a model of epistemic and ontological cognition. This model incorporates ideas from philosophical epistemology, including a focus on students' multiple means of justification. Concerns regarding the psychometric qualities of quantitative measures of personal epistemology inform this model and its proposed operationalization. We suggest a means of statistical analysis that can be used to assess the construct and predictive validity of this conceptual model by testing the relations among positions, dimensions, and covariates of interest. Future research directions include investigating how individuals choose among various forms of justification.

We describe ongoing research that examines the beliefs held by teachers, instructional practices, and the consistency between beliefs and classroom practices. We summarize findings from our research and discuss their implications for teacher training. We also consider environmental factors such as school culture and mandated standards that affect teachers' beliefs. We relate our findings to implications for teacher training.

Researchers on both sides of the Atlantic have converged on accounts that describe students' epistemological development in terms of a sequence or hierarchy of qualitatively distinct stages or positions. The rich qualitative data obtained from longitudinal investigations do demonstrate intellectual changes, but whether the same scheme fits all students and whether the changes found are a specific result of exposure to higher education are open to debate. Well-validated quantitative instruments that could be used to measure epistemological development in large samples of students are still lacking. Unresolved issues include: whether students can adopt multiple epistemological positions; whether these are culturally and contextually specific; and whether they are mental entities, discursive practices or social constructions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In multilevel modeling, group-level variables (L2) for assessing contextual effects are frequently generated by aggregating variables from a lower level (L1). A major problem of contextual analyses in the social sciences is that there is no error-free measurement of constructs. In the present article, 2 types of error occurring in multilevel data when estimating contextual effects are distinguished: unreliability that is due to measurement error and unreliability that is due to sampling error. The fact that studies may or may not correct for these 2 types of error can be translated into a 2 × 2 taxonomy of multilevel latent contextual models comprising 4 approaches: an uncorrected approach, partial correction approaches correcting for either measurement or sampling error (but not both), and a full correction approach that adjusts for both sources of error. It is shown mathematically and with simulated data that the uncorrected and partial correction approaches can result in substantially biased estimates of contextual effects, depending on the number of L1 individuals per group, the number of groups, the intraclass correlation, the number of indicators, and the size of the factor loadings. However, the simulation study also shows that partial correction approaches can outperform full correction approaches when the data provide only limited information in terms of the L2 construct (i.e., small number of groups, low intraclass correlation). A real-data application from educational psychology is used to illustrate the different approaches.},

abstract = {Experts in cognitive domains differ from non-experts in how they represent problems and knowledge, and in their epistemic understandings of tasks in their domain of expertise. This study investigates whether task-specific epistemic understanding also underlies the representation of knowledge on an everyday reasoning task on which the competent reasoners have neither expert domain knowledge nor training. 180 people on jury duty were assessed for epistemological understanding about the nature of knowledge and knowing in general, understanding of the specific task of the juror, and level of argument skill and evidence representation on two jury cases. Epistemic construal of the juror task and task-specific competent reasoning was found related to general epistemology, argument skills, and representation of the evidence. Additionally, estimations of the possibility of certainty in general and in a juror task predicted the participants' expressed certainty about their verdict choices. Implications for developing everyday reasoning competence are discussed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A teaching program designed to foster a reflection on and development of more sophisticated epistemological beliefs was implemented with 29 pre-service graduate teacher education students at the Queensland University of Technology. As part of the year-long teaching program, students were required to reflect in journal entries on the content of an educational psychology unit in relation to their epistemological beliefs. The students engaged in this teaching program (research group) were interviewed in relation to their beliefs at the beginning (Time 1) and conclusion (Time 2) of the program. Students in a comparison group were not encouraged to explicitly reflect on their epistemological beliefs but completed written statements about their beliefs about knowing at the beginning (T1) and end (T2) of the year-long unit. M. A. Schommer's (1988, 1990) epistemological beliefs questionnaire was administered to both groups at T1 and T2. This questionnaire measured beliefs about knowing. The results of both the quantitative and qualitative data analysis indicate that the group of students engaged in the teaching program experienced more growth in sophisticated epistemological beliefs. The success of the program has implications for how teacher educators develop learning environments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{Elby2001,
abstract = {Among researchers who study students' epistemologies, a consensus has emerged about what constitutes a sophisticated stance toward scientific knowledge. Ac- cording to this community consensus, students should understand scientific knowledge as tentative and evolving, rather than certain and unchanging; subjectively tied to scientists' perspectives, rather than objectively inherent in nature; and individually or socially con- structed, rather than discovered. Surveys, interview protocols, and other methods used to probe students' beliefs about scientific knowledge broadly reflect this outlook. This arti- cle questions the community consensus about epistemological sophistication. We do not suggest that scientific knowledge is objective and fixed; if forced to choose whether knowl- edge is certain or tentative, with no opportunity to elaborate, we would choose “tentative.” Instead, our critique consists of two lines of argument. First, the literature fails to distin- guish between the correctness and productivity of an epistemological belief. For instance, elementary school students who believe that science is about discovering objective truths to questions, such as whether the earth is round or flat, or whether an asteroid led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, may be more likely to succeed in science than students who believe science is about telling stories that vary with one's perspective. Na¨ ıve realism, al- though incorrect (according to a broad consensus of philosophers and social scientists), may nonetheless be productive for helping those students learn. Second, according to the con- sensus viewas reflected in commonly used surveys, epistemological sophistication consists of believing certain blanket generalizations about the nature of knowledge and learning, generalizations that do not attend to context. These generalizations are neither correct nor productive. For example, it would be unsophisticated for students to view as tentative the idea that the earth is round rather than flat. By contrast, they should take a more tenta- tive stance toward theories of mass extinction. Nonetheless, many surveys and interview protocols tally students as sophisticated not for attending to these contextual nuances, but C for subscribing broadly to the viewthat knowledge is tentative.},

This framework simultaneously considers individual differences in cognitive abilities, self-regulatory processes of motivation, and IPR demands. Evidence for the framework is provided in the context of skill acquisition, in which IPR and ability demands change as a function of practice, training paradigm, and timing of goal setting (GS). Three field-based lab experiments were conducted with 1,010 US Air Force trainees. Exp 1 evaluated the basic ability–performance parameters of the air traffic controller task and GS effects early in practice. Exp 2 evaluated GS later in practice. Exp 3 investigated the simultaneous effects of training content, GS and ability–performance interactions. Results support the theoretical framework and have implications for notions of ability–motivation interactions and design of training and motivation programs.

Questionnaires were used to measure beliefs, paper-and-pencil based achievement tests to measure knowledge, and a video-based test to measure perception and planning abilities. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that prospective preschool teachers' mathematics-related beliefs can be distinguished into a static, a process, and an application orientation. Structural equation modeling revealed that an application orientation and mathematics pedagogical content knowledge can predict the ability to perceive mathematical learning situations and to plan adequate actions. Conclusions for preschool teacher education are drawn from the results.},

The effect of teachers' professional competence on student outcomes was estimated in a 1-year repeated-measures design. Two-level structural equation models revealed positive effects of teachers' pedagogical content knowledge, enthusiasm for teaching, and self-regulatory skills on instructional quality, which in turn affected student outcomes. In contrast, teachers' general academic ability did not affect their instruction. The multidimensional model of teachers' professional competence introduced in this article seems suited to stimulate further research on the personal indicators of teacher quality.

abstract = {Abstract In conventional structural equation models, all latent variables and indicators vary between units (typically subjects) and are assumed to be independent across units. The latter assumption is violated in multilevel settings where units are nested in clusters, leading to within-cluster dependence. Different approaches to extending structural equation models for such multilevel settings are examined. The most common approach is to formulate separate within-cluster and between-cluster models. An advantage of this set-up is that it allows software for conventional structural equation models to be ‘tricked' into estimating the model. However, the standard implementation of this approach does not permit cross-level paths from latent or observed variables at a higher level to latent or observed variables at a lower level, and does not allow for indicators varying at higher levels. A multilevel regression (or path) model formulation is therefore suggested in which some of the response variables and some of the explanatory variables at the different levels are latent and measured by multiple indicators. The Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Modeling (GLLAMM) framework allows such models to be specified by simply letting the usual structural part of the model include latent and observed variables varying at different levels. Models of this kind are applied to the U.S. sample of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000 to investigate the relationship between the school-level latent variable ‘teacher excellence' and the student-level latent variable ‘reading ability', each measured by multiple ordinal indicators.},

abstract = {Focusing on the teaching profession, this study examines the association between school-specific demands and resources, on the one hand, and engagement and exhaustion, on the other. Individual-level data obtained from 1,939 secondary teachers as well as school-level data from their principals and students, based on 198 German schools, were subjected to multilevel analysis. School-level characteristics accounted for only a small amount of the variance in teachers' emotional exhaustion. In contrast, teachers' engagement differed considerably between schools. For the two outcome variables, engagement and exhaustion, specific patterns of predictive effects were observed at the school level: when controlling for individual teacher characteristics, the principal's support in educational matters predicted higher levels of engagement, whereas disciplinary problems in the classroom predicted higher emotional exhaustion. Although school-level data were associated with engagement and exhaustion, results suggest paying particular attention to individual differences between teachers that might predispose them to develop either more engagement or emotional exhaustion.

In our present study we investigated whether accessing information from multiple documents instead of a single document might alleviate this problem by motivating readers to integrate information. We further tested whether this effect would be moderated by source expertise. One hundred undergraduates read the same medical information purportedly written by either medical experts or laypeople, which was presented as one document or spread across four documents. Results revealed partial support for our hypotheses. Readers of multiple documents exhibited superior memory for conflicts and provided a more balanced description of conflicting information in essays they wrote. Variation of author expertise moderated the effect of presentation format in the essay task but not on the memory test. The results extend previous research by showing that multiple documents reading also stimulates the integration of conflicting information.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to focus on the career of the burnout concept itself, rather than reviewing research findings on burnout. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents an overview of the concept of burnout. Findings: The roots of the burnout concept seem to be embedded within broad social, economic, and cultural developments that took place in the last quarter of the past century and signify the rapid and profound transformation from an industrial society into a service economy. This social transformation goes along with psychological pressures that may translate into burnout. After the turn of the century, burnout is increasingly considered as an erosion of a positive psychological state. Although burnout seems to be a global phenomenon, the meaning of the concept differs between countries. For instance, in some countries burnout is used as a medical diagnosis, whereas in other countries it is a non-medical, socially accepted label that carries a minimum stigma in terms of a psychiatric diagnosis. Originality/value: The paper documents that the exact meaning of the concept of burnout varies with its context and the intentions of those using the term.

abstract = {Propensity score analysis is a method that equates treatment and control groups on a comprehensive set of measured confounders in observational (nonrandomized) studies. A successful propensity score analysis reduces bias in the estimate of the average treatment effect in a nonrandomized study, making the estimate more comparable with that obtained from a randomized experiment. This article reviews and discusses an important practical issue in propensity analysis, in which the baseline covariates (potential confounders) and the outcome have missing values (incompletely observed). We review the statistical theory of propensity score analysis and estimation methods for propensity scores with incompletely observed covariates. Traditional logistic regression and modern machine learning methods (e.g., random forests, generalized boosted modeling) as estimation methods for incompletely observed covariates are reviewed. Balance diagnostics and equating methods for incompletely observed covariates are briefly described. Using an empirical example, the propensity score estimation methods for incompletely observed covariates are illustrated and compared. In the prototypical observational study, participants are mea-sured on a set of covariates at baseline (pretreatment), they then receive a treatment or control intervention, and, finally, one or more outcome variables are measured (Rosenbaum, 2010). Given nonrandom assignment to treatment (t) or control (c) groups, there are typically baseline covariates that are common causes of the assignment to t versus c and the outcome variable. These variables are termed confounders. Lack of proper statistical adjustment for confounders will produce a biased estimate of the causal effect in an observational study. To equate the t and c groups at baseline, Rubin (2001) has recom-mended that a comprehensive set of covariates that are potential confounders be measured because the actual confounders are un-known. Moser, West, and Hughes (2012) measured 72 covariates in a study comparing the subsequent academic achievement of children who were retained in first grade (t group) or promoted to second grade (c group) at the end of their first school year. West et al. (2014) measured 98 covariates in a study investigating the well-being of patients who received versus those who did not receive telephone counseling. Traditional exact matching methods will fail when more than a few covariates are measured because appropriate matches cannot be created (see Chapin, 1947, for an example). Traditional analysis of covariance may produce inappropriate results if there are nonlinear covariate-outcome relationships and the baseline distribu-tions of the covariates of the two groups do not fully overlap (Schafer {\&} Kang, 2008). Propensity score analysis, originally developed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), can be used to equate the distributions of a large number of measured covariates in the t and c groups, producing a less biased estimate of the causal effect. Comprehensive reviews of the use of propensity score analysis with complete data are available (In practice, the measured covariates (putative confounders) and out-come often have missing values. To the authors' knowledge, there has been no comprehensive review of methods for addressing these prob-lems in propensity score analysis. This is the primary goal of the present article. The structure of the article is as follows. First, we briefly review of the theory of propensity scores when the covariates are com-pletely observed, followed by a presentation of the theory for incompletely observed covariates. Second, we consider methods of estimating propensity scores, beginning with the traditional logis-tic regression method followed by newer machine learning meth-ods. Machine learning methods, often used with big data sets, can make correct predictions (here, of the propensity score for treat-ment assignment) without specifying each of the covariates and their relationship to the outcome. Third, we discuss balance diag-nostics, equating methods, and sensitivity analysis for incomplete covariates. Fourth, we present an illustrative example that applies these methods to an empirical data set with incompletely observed covariates. Fifth, we discuss propensity score analysis when the outcome variable has missing values. Finally, we discuss other issues in propensity score analysis with covariates having missing data. Our focus in this article is on the prototypical observational study in which the participants are nonrandomly assigned to t or c and whose goal is to estimate the causal effect of the treatment on the outcome variable Y.},

abstract = {An important problem in multilevel modeling is what constitutes a sufficient sample size for accurate estimation. In multilevel analysis, the major restriction is often the higher-level sample size. In this paper, a simulation study is used to determine the influence of different sample sizes at the group level on the accuracy of the estimates (regression coefficients and variances) and their standard errors. In addition, the influence of other factors, such as the lowest-level sample size and different variance distributions between the levels (different intraclass correlations), is examined. The results show that only a small sample size at level two (meaning a sample of 50 or less) leads to biased estimates of the second-level standard errors. In all of the other simulated conditions the estimates of the regression coefficients, the variance components, and the standard errors are unbiased and accurate.

Additionally, it is unknown whether different evaluation sources converge when the TBC is used. This study examined self-and student ratings of 35 instructors. The same characteristics that affect student ratings using other instrumentation impact student evaluation via the TBC. Further, several course and instructor variables impacted instructor self-evaluations. Instructor self-ratings did not correlate significantly with the ratings provided by the students.

abstract = {Abstract: The growth of scientific and technological knowledge in modern societies has lead to an increase of specialization of knowledge and expertise. Most socio-scientific issues are far too complex to be understood deeply by laypersons. From various disciplines we have to choose pertinent ones if we want to rely on expert advice. Epistemological beliefs might be helpful to cope with this challenge. Furthermore it is necessary to have realistic awareness of one's own fragmentary understanding and to avoid the ``illusion of explanatory depth'' (Rosenblit {\{}{\&}{\}} Keil, 2002). In order to research on adults' capability to choose between disciplines who might be relevant for a science topic, N = 520 secondary school students were asked to choose, which of 22 scientific disciplines (e.g. math, geology, biology) should contribute to a book about tide and float. They were also asked to assess their own knowledge about the theme. Influence of epistemological beliefs has been tested by an epistemological sensitization in an experimental design. The epistemological sensitization significantly influences students' self-assessment of knowledge and discipline rating. Students with sophisticated epistemological beliefs were more critical about their own knowledge about tide and flow, chose significantly pertinent and -by tendency- potential pertinent disciplines more and declined non-pertinent disciplines more.},

The data confirm previous observations that cheating is a prevalent behavior among college students and some forms of cheating (e.g., copying homework) occur at greater rates than others (e.g., cheating on exams). The data also support previous observations concerning sex differences and differences in the rates of cheating between larger and smaller institutions. Specifically, men tend to report higher levels of cheating than do women for most forms of cheating. Similarly, students at larger institutions tend to report higher levels of cheating than students at smaller institutions. There were also significant negative correlations between social desirability and rates of cheating. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Our first purpose in this article is to contribute case study, classroom-based evidence of the role of epistemology in student learning. Most existing research has taken place through specialized interviews or surveys, but "there may not be a clean correspondence between how students respond to these questions and how they actually approach learning", so it is important to study the nature and role of epistemologies in everyday settings. We present a conversation that took place in J. Phelan's eighth-grade science class, and we give evidence that epistemological knowledge played a significant role in the students' approach to an activity. Our second purpose is to contribute evidence of variability, to promote a change in the ontology by which researchers understand personal epistemologies. Currently, researchers mostly conceptualize personal epistemology in terms of unitary stages of development or systems of belief. There is, however, evidence of variability in personal epistemologies as we review following and as we show in the eighth-graders' conversation. We have analyzed an episode of inquiry in science among a group of eighth-grade students with respect to their epistemologies. At the outset of the conversation, prior to the teacher's intervention, the indications in the data are consistent with previous research that has identified counterproductive beliefs: The students treat knowledge as comprised of isolated, simple pieces of information expressed with specific vocabulary and provided by authority.

Student and instructor comments are reported within the context of self-regulated learning. Results support the conjecture that even a narrow use of WeBWorK, as a substitute for handwritten homework, is at least as effective as traditionally graded paper and pencil homework for students learning college algebra.

We present a brief review of the psychometric literature on coefficient alpha, followed by a practical alternative in the form of coefficient omega. To facilitate the shift from alpha to omega, we also present a brief guide to the calculation of point and interval estimates of omega using a free, open source software environment.},

Although it is well understood as a theoretical construct, the measurement of cognitive load induced by instructional materials in general, and by multimedia instruction in particular, mainly relies on methods that are either indirect, subjective, or both. Integrating aspects of CLT, working memory research, and cognitive theories of multimedia learning, we describe the conceptual basis and practical implementation of a dual-task approach to the direct measurement of cognitive load in multimedia learning. This computer-based instrument provides a direct and objective measure that overcomes many of the shortcomings of other indirect and subjective methods that will enable researchers to validate empirically theoretical predictions of CLT.

abstract = {Teachers' general pedagogical/psychological knowledge (PPK) can be defined as the knowledge needed to create and optimize teaching-learning situations across subjects, including declarative and procedural knowledge of classroom management, teaching methods, classroom assessment, and student heterogeneity. Although PPK is thought to be an important aspect of teacher quality, it has seen little empirical investigation--largely because no direct and valid measure of PPK has previously been available. Study 1 describes the development of a 39-item measure using multiple-choice items, short-answer items, and video-based items to assess PPK. Experts rated the items to be relevant for teaching and domain general. Study 2 provides further evidence for the measure's validity. Data obtained from 746 German teacher candidates supported the hypothesized nomological network of PPK; the measure was sensitive to differences between groups; and variations in PPK did not overlap to any great extent with variations in discriminant constructs such as general reasoning abilities, personal beliefs, and domain-specific knowledge. Furthermore, PPK was positively associated with indicators of instructional quality from the students' perspective. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Based on the COPES-model (Winne {\&} Hadwin, 1998) the impact of epistemological beliefs on learning is tested here experimentally. In this study, students (21 humanities students, 14 biology students) had to solve five tasks of different complexity (Anderson et al., 2001) with a hypertext on "genetic fingerprinting". Results indicate that students adapted their concurrent thoughts and concurrent actions to task complexity in this enactment stage. An epistemological sensitisation was administered that elicited more "sophisticated" beliefs and caused more elaborate learning processes. For example, students with this sensitisation employed more metacognitive planning, especially for more complex tasks. Additionally, effects of prior domain knowledge were investigated.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the challenges that arise when knowledge production occurs in cross-disciplinary settings. To date most studies on communities of practice have focused on knowledge production within communities of practice rather than across communities of practice. We analyse the various professional groups in a medical R{\{}{\&}{\}}D department as a constellation of distinct, but interconnected communities of practice with different epistemic cultures. The medical R{\{}{\&}{\}}D case is particularly interesting for this purpose, because it involved creating new cross-disciplinary practices between different pre-existing and well-established communities of practice. In line with our focus on the challenges and processes involved in cross-disciplinary knowledge production, we describe negotiations and tensions during the establishment of the department, as well as in day-to-day practice. In particular, we focus on how the 'machineries of knowledge production', that is, the actual mechanisms by which knowledge is pursued, are different across the various communities of practice. These machineries belong to different epistemic cultures on a national or even international scale, and thus every community of practice is part of a complex web of people, activities and material structures extending well beyond the immediate work context. This networked character of knowing in practice explain why learning on the system level of communities of practice can be challenging. It may lead to path-dependent learning processes, and radical change can become limited if the knowledge required by new and different practices is incompatible with the existing stock of knowledge. Consequently, we suggest that the communities of practice approach could be enriched by looking at diversity and discontinuity in the epistemic cultures and networks that the different communities of practice are associated with.

The contested and diverse nature of both constructs makes untangling their connections a complex yet vital task. The purpose of this article is to advance the discussion regarding this intersection by offering a theoretical approach that may serve as a basis for analyzing epistemic thinking and aligning it with current views of metacognition. Based on a synthesis of theoretical and empirical studies, we argue that epistemic thinking is a multifaceted construct with both cognitive and metacognitive aspects. Furthermore, we propose that epistemic metacognition includes several aspects such as metacognitive skills; metacognitive knowledge about persons, strategies and tasks; and metacognitive experiences. The theoretical, methodological, and instructional implications of this approach are explored.},

The result is similar to that found by M. Schommer with North American university students in that the number of dimensions is the same but the nature of the dimensions is different. The paper hypothesizes that these differences can be accounted for in terms of differences in cultural context. In particular, the difference in dimensions concerned with authority--expert knowledge and effort and learning reported in this study might be explained by value differences between Western (North American) and non-Western (Hong Kong Chinese) culture. From a methodological perspective, the interview data (from 23 of the above students) also imply difficulties in measuring knowledge beliefs and one finding from the study is that in-depth interviews to complement quantitative data are necessary for trustworthy study of epistemological beliefs.

abstract = {This study reported an investigation of eighth graders' (14-year-olds) web searching strategies and outcomes, and then analyzed their correlations with students' web experiences, epistemological beliefs, and the nature of searching tasks. Eighty-seven eighth graders were asked to fill out a questionnaire for probing epistemological beliefs (from positivist to constructivist-oriented views) and finished three different types of searching tasks. Their searching process was recorded by screen capture software and answers were reviewed by two expert teachers based on their accuracy, richness and soundness. Five quantitative indicators were used to assess students' searching strategies: number of keywords, visited pages, maximum depth of exploration, refinement of keyword, and number of words used in the first keyword. The main findings derived from this study suggested that, students with richer web experiences could find more correct answers in "close-ended" search tasks. In addition, students with better metacognitive skills such as keyword refinement tended to achieve more successful searching outcomes in such tasks. However, in "open-ended" tasks, where questions were less certain and answers were more elaborated, students who had more advanced epistemological beliefs, concurring with a constructivist view, had better searching outcomes in terms of their soundness and richness. This study has concluded that epistemological beliefs play an influential role in open-ended Internet learning environments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

abstract = {The transition to work is an important phase in the process of teachers' professional development. However, there is evidence that not all teachers deal successfully with the demands of the transition resulting in high levels of occupational stress and burnout symptoms. The present study investigates first the development of emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction in the first two years of beginning teachers. Second, we investigate the effects of personality traits, previous educational experiences, pedagogical content knowledge, knowledge about classroom behavior and self-regulatory skills on student teachers emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. The data consists of more than 500 beginning teachers in their practical phase of teacher education, who were examined in a multi-cohort longitudinal study. The results suggest that emotional exhaustion increases significantly in the first year of teaching practice, while it remains stable in the second year Compared to a sample of experienced teachers, beginning teachers report similar emotional exhaustion but higher job satisfaction. Personality traits as well as aspects of professional knowledge and educational experience explained interindividual differences in the development of exhaustion and satisfaction over one year. The implications of the present results for the professional development of teachers are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

The framework distinguishes three phases through which math tasks pass before student learning is accomplished: the task as it appears in curricular/instructional materials, the task as set up or announced by a teacher, and the task as implemented by students. This framework is not a rigid prescription of what must happen, rather, it is a tool for reflection that should highlight what students are doing and thinking about during math lessons. The writers describe the way some math teachers have used this framework.},

Principles for modeling the architecture of personality, that is, the overall design and operating characteristics of intraindividual personality systems, are addressed. Research demonstrates that a focus on within-person structures and processes advances the understanding of two aspects of personality coherence: the functional relations among distinct elements of personality, and cross-situational coherence in personality functioning that results from interactions among enduring knowledge structures and dynamic appraisal processes. Also reviewed are recent conceptual and empirical advances, which demonstrate that the interindividual personality variables that summarize variability in the population are wholly insufficient for modeling intraindividual personality architecture.},

On the basis of responses from 495 teacher trainees and 224 in-service teachers, the development and validation of an advanced goal orientation measure is presented. Internal consistencies of the goal dimensions were good, and confirmatory factor analyses verified the postulated model for teacher trainees and in-service teachers. In both groups, learning goal orientation positively predicted self-efficacy for teaching and perceived benefits of help-seeking. Performance approach goals positively predicted self-efficacy for teaching and performance avoidance goals negatively predicted self-efficacy for teaching and positively predicted perceived threats of help-seeking. The use of goal orientation facets provided a more thorough analysis of the predictions regarding perceptions of help-seeking. Results supported the convergent and divergent validity of the new measure. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The purpose was to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of changes in students? conceptions of learning. However, the initial analysis of the data directed our attention to the epistemological aspects, and we continued the analysis by applying Bendixen and Rule?s Integrative Personal Epistemology Model. The students? educational experiences showed that their epistemological beliefs changed over a period of time from absolutism towards relativism and that the pedagogical environment played an important role in this process. On the basis of the study, we suggest that it is already possible to influence the advancement of university students? epistemological beliefs at an early stage in their studies.},

abstract = {The primary aim was to explore and compare the dimensionality of personal epistemology with respect to climate change across the contexts of Norwegian and Spanish students. A second aim was to examine relationships between topic-specific epistemic beliefs and the variables of gender, topic knowledge, and topic interest in the two contexts. Participants were 225 Norwegian and 217 Spanish undergraduates enrolled in psychology or education courses, and the dimensionality of topic-specific personal epistemology was explored through factor analyses of the scores on a 49-item questionnaire. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to predict scores on the epistemic belief dimensions emerging from the factor analyses with gender, topic knowledge, and topic interest, respectively. Even though considerable cross-cultural generalizability in dimensionality was demonstrated, this research also draws attention to the cultural embeddedness of topic-specific epistemic beliefs. Moreover, differences in the predictability of topic knowledge and topic interest in Norway and Spain, suggest that factors constraining or enhancing adaptive epistemic beliefs concerning particular topics may vary across cultures.

Wie viele (Quantit{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}t) und welche (Qualit{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}t) Dimensionen geh{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}ren zum Konstrukt der epistemologischen {\{}{\"{U}}{\}}berzeugungen? 2. Welches Instrument ist geeignet, epistemologische {\{}{\"{U}}{\}}berzeugungen zu erfassen? Hierzu f{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}hrt die Autorin eine theoriegeleitete Analyse des Konstrukts der epistemologischen {\{}{\"{U}}{\}}berzeugungen durch, die durch empirische Ergebnisse erg{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}nzt wird. Ausgehend von einer mehrdimensionalen Modellvorstellung epistemologischer {\{}{\"{U}}{\}}berzeugungen werden 161 Handelslehramtsstudierende mittels Fragebogen und Netzinterview befragt. Die quantitativen und qualitativen Ergebnisse werden im Sinne der Triangulation aufeinander bezogen und in einem Referenzmodell zusammengef{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}hrt. Das Resultat ist vielversprechend: Es konnten mit Hilfe des Methoden-Mix sechs Dimensionen epistemologischer {\{}{\"{U}}{\}}berzeugungen repliziert werden. Dar{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}ber hinaus wurden Hinweise auf weitere Randdimensionen und Aspekte des Konstrukts gewonnen.{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} (Autorenreferat).},

That by Bryk and Raudenbush (1992) discusses 2 and 3-level linear multilevel models with applications especially to educational data and also to repeated measures designs. Longford (1993) gives a more theoretically oriented account and includes additionally discussion of a multilevel factor analysis model, models with categorical responses and multivariate models. The present volume aims to integrate existing methodological developments within a consistent terminology and notation, provide examples and explain a number of new developments, especially in the areas of discrete response data, time series models, random cross classifications, errors of measurement, missing data and nonlinear models. In many cases these developments are the subject of continuing research, so that we can expect further elaborations of the procedures described.The main text seeks to avoid undue statistical complexity, with methodological derivations occurring in appendices. Examples and diagrams are used to illustrate the application of the techniques and references given to other work.

abstract = {In today's elementary classrooms, children are expected to acquire knowledge and skills to ensure that they will be able to maintain and further the cultural, economic, and scientific accomplishments of our societies as responsible citizens. As a result, early on in their school career, elementary school students are exposed to a diversity of knowledge and skills explained to them by their teachers, systematized in curricula and syllabi, and conveyed through instruction, school books, and other educational materials. The goal of this chapter is to consider how the actual nature of the knowledge and skills to be learned is portrayed and perceived in elementary classrooms. That is, how is the nature of knowledge and knowing presented by teachers, instruction, and educational materials? From an educational perspective, is knowledge conveyed as black-and-white, stripped from its complexity and ambiguity, and assessed in a right-or-wrong fashion? From a more disciplinary perspective, are different ways of knowing along with their characteristic subjectivities and tentativeness acknowledged by teachers, instruction, and educational materials? Correspondingly, what are the beliefs of elementary school students about knowledge and knowing and are their epistemic beliefs influenced by (such) common classroom components? Do elementary students believe in the objectivity of knowledge and the existence of absolute truth? Or do they think of knowledge as being more delicate and subject to change? Taking all of these different classroom components and influences into consideration, the overarching questions of this chapter include: what is the epistemic climate of elementary classrooms, what does it look like, and what is its possible educational potential?

Allerdings haben nur wenige Studien die These von den negativen Selektionseffekten bei den kognitiven und psychosozialen Eingangsvoraussetzungen zuk{\"{u}}nftiger Lehrkr{\"{a}}fte empirisch untersucht.

abstract = {The current study examines the assertion that students are motivated and learn more by carrying out tasks consistent with their epistemological beliefs in web-based learning environments. In the study, 120 undergraduate students in an educational technology course participated as part of their coursework. Using a wiki, triads reciprocally asked and responded to questions as constructing either a group summary or a group argument. Students with less advanced epistemological beliefs more actively coordinated formats and procedures for group work and achieved higher comprehension of reading materials in the collaborative summary than in the collaborative argumentation. By contrast, these differences were not found for students with more advanced epistemological beliefs. However, the interaction effect between tasks and epistemological beliefs disappeared for the quality of argumentation on case problems. Independently of epistemological beliefs, collaborative argumentation promoted more constructive and interactive peer questioning activities and helped to construct higher quality arguments in case problems than collaborative summary. Therefore, the effects of matching tasks and epistemological beliefs varied depending on types of learning outcomes (comprehension vs. argumentation) in online peer questioning. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Adults (N = 174) ranging in age from 17 to 71 years old with a mean age of 38 completed the Schommer Epistemological Questionnaire (M. Schommer, 1990), which assessed their beliefs in the certainty and organization of knowledge and the speed and control of learning. After they had completed the questionnaire, they responded to a series of questions about two controversial issues that had been discussed in the local newspaper. Regression analyses indicated that the more the participants believed in complex and tentative knowledge, the more likely they were to take on multiple perspectives, be willing to modify their thinking, withhold ultimate deci-sions until all information was available, and acknowledge the complex, tentative nature of everyday issues. Epistemological beliefs that are heavily influenced by a higher level of education appear to relate to thinking beyond the classroom, and introducing controversial issues into the curriculum may reciprocally foster the development of epistemological beliefs.},

abstract = {Cognitive Activation in the Mathematics Classroom and Professional Competence of Teachers presents the findings of the Professional Competence of Teachers, Cognitively Activating Instruction, and Development of Students´ Mathematical Literacy project (COACTIV). COACTIV applies a broad, innovative conceptualization of teacher competence to examine how mathematics teachers' knowledge, beliefs, motivational orientations, and self-regulation skills influence their instructional practice and teaching outcomes. Moreover, it gauges the effects of these teacher characteristics on student learning, as indexed by the progress of students in each class. For this book, COACTIV study data relating to various aspects of teacher competence and classroom instruction from the perspective of both the teachers themselves and their students was collected and analyzed. Questions addressed and discussed include: What are the characteristics of successful teaching? What distinguishes teachers who succeed in their profession? How can the quality of instruction be improved? Written for researchers from a broad range of areas, such as educational psychology, general education, and mathematics education, this book effectively demonstrates how teacher competence relates directly to measurable student learning gains.},

abstract = {This dissertation examines relations between personal epistemology and facets of self-regulated learning, moves away from correlational designs, and adopts a more process-oriented methodology. For this study, a philosophical conceptualization of epistemology was integrated with conceptualizations from educational psychology and mathematics education. The primary purpose of this study was to examine relations between approaches to knowing, mathematics problem solving, and regulation of cognition. A secondary purpose was to examine whether mathematics students become more rational in their approaches to knowing and whether their epistemic beliefs change through higher levels of education. One hundred twenty-seven students were sampled from undergraduate university mathematics and statistics courses. Students completed self-report measures to reflect epistemic styles, epistemic beliefs, and dispositions regarding elements of self-regulated learning. Students were profiled as predominantly rational, predominantly empirical, or both rational and empirical in their approaches to knowing. Seventeen students were chosen to participate in two problem-solving sessions. Problem-solving episodes were coded for evidence of planning, monitoring, control, use of empirical and rational argumentation, and justification for solutions. Differences in self-reported metacognitive self-regulation were found between students profiled as high on rationalism and empiricism and students profiled as predominantly empirical. No other self-reported differences were found. When problem solving, students profiled as predominantly rational had the highest frequency of planning, monitoring, and control. These differences were attributed to patterns identified in students' self-efficacy. No differences in rationalism scores were found between lower- and upper-year university students but differences were found in their beliefs about the structure of knowledge and the source of knowledge. Differences were also found in the quality of rational arguments between lower- and upper-year university students when solving problems. Students profiled as predominantly rational in their approaches to knowing were predominantly rational in their approaches to problems solving. Similarly, students profiled as predominantly empirical in their approaches to knowing were predominantly empirical in their approaches to problem solving. Finally, students profiled as both rational and empirical in their approaches to knowing were predominantly rational in their approaches to problem solving. Results are discussed in the context of various theoretical frameworks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

In a simple CO trial, each subject receives each treatment in random order. A powerful characteristic of this design is that each subject serves as its own control. In a CR CO trial, clusters of subjects are randomly allocated to a sequence of interventions. Under this design, each subject is either included in only one of the treatment periods (CO at cluster level) or in both periods (CO at subject level). In this study, the efficiency of both CR CO trials relative to the CR trial without CO is demonstrated. Furthermore, the optimal allocation of clusters and subjects given a fixed budget or desired power level is discussed.},

Using video in teacher education can increase pre-service teachers' ability to apply knowledge. However, video is not effective in itself. To be useful, it must be embedded in appropriate instructional contexts. We investigated the differential impact of two university modules---one using video as an illustrative example (rule-example) and one using video as an anchor (example-rule)---on pre-service teachers' (N{\~{}}={\~{}}56) knowledge. The rule-example group scored higher on reproducing factual knowledge and evaluating videotaped classroom situations, whereas the example-rule group scored higher on lesson planning. The findings emphasize the need for their targeted use depending on specific learning goals.},

abstract = {The term epistemological beliefs (EBs) refers to the nature of students' beliefs of knowledge and learning, these are related to the learning process through their effect on academic performance, motivation and self-regulation. Schommer has argued that the concept is multidimensional and consists of four distinct dimensions, the structure of knowledge, the stability of knowledge, the ability of learning and the speed of learning. The aim of the present study is to explore the structure of epistemic beliefs in a Greek sample, according to the theoretical model of Schommer, and how these beliefs are related to academic performance and other demographic and non demographic variables. The sample was composed by 470 students attending the three grades of upper high school. The students responded to the Epistemological Belief Questionnaire (Schommer, 2000). The results showed that the structure of the epistemological beliefs is in accordance to Schommer's theoretical model as regards the four dimensions and that the dimension structure of knowledge was the strongest factor. Low reliability rates lead to doubts regarding Schommer's conceptual model. Moreover, it was found that ability of learning and stability of knowledge significantly contribute to the prediction of academic performance and that higher grades are related to sophisticated EBs. It was also found that girls have more sophisticated EBs than boys in the speed of learning, and that older students have more sophisticated EBs in the stability of knowledge. Similar findings were found for the students of the theoretical study direction in terms of the stability and the structure of knowledge.

The use of definition variables (i.e., observed variables used to fix model parameters to individual specific data values) is extended to the case of ML-SEMs for clustered data with random slopes. Empirical examples of multilevel CFA and ML-SEM with random slopes are provided along with scripts for fitting such models in SAS Proc Mixed, Mplus, and Mx.

Latent class transition analyses were conducted to determine the stability and change of latent class membership across two time points. For both baseline and follow-up measures, latent class analyses suggested that two latent classes were most appropriate for characterizing the youths using the four domains of risk factors. One class reflected youths reporting few problems in any risk area; the second class reflected youths reporting problems in many of the risk domains. The latent class transition analyses indicated that about two thirds of the youths experienced similar problems over time. The results emphasize the heterogeneity of this study's sample.

abstract = {Research findings have revealed that teachers' perceptions of their own instructional quality are often inappropriate. Our research dealt with two research questions. First, how closely are teachers' ratings of instruction associated with their students' ratings? Second, do teachers share a stronger consensus with their students than visiting colleagues do? Data were collected by means of questionnaires and analyzed using the correlated-trait - correlated-method minus one (CTC(M-1)) model (Eid, 2000). Our results show low consistency between teacher and student ratings, which is not higher than between students and colleagues. Consequences for research and practice are discussed. },

abstract = {College and university faculty and administrators are responsible for constructing academic honesty policies and communicating them to students. This is often attempted through institutional honesty policies and university-wide honor codes. While these approaches have been widely researched, less attention has been given to the role of individual faculty members. That role is examined in this study by addressing student reactions to professors based on their academic honesty policies. In addition to demographic information, data were gathered about student attitudes and beliefs concerning academic dishonesty and their decision to enroll in or avoid a course being taught by a professor with zero tolerance for academic dishonesty. The findings regarding different instructors' approaches toward academic dishonesty indicate that an intolerant policy will keep dishonest students away, but at a price—it will also detract many honest students.},

Five categories were identified: beliefs about mathematics, development of beliefs, effects of beliefs on behavior, domain differences, and changing beliefs. Studies examining beliefs about mathematics revealed consistent patterns of nonavailing beliefs at all educational levels. Mathematics instructional environments were inferred to influence the development of beliefs about mathematics. All studies revealed significant relationships between beliefs and cognition, motivation, and academic achievement. Descriptive studies found relationships between beliefs and learning behaviors. Studies examining domain differences found significant variations in beliefs across disciplines. Studies focusing on changing beliefs were successful, which was attributed to appropriate changes in instructional style. The article concludes with suggestions for future research.},

In order to fully exploit the potential of example-based learning, teachers should, however, know how to effectively employ such examples in classroom instruction. Therefore, we have designed a computer-based learning environment in which mathematics and science teachers learn how to effectively employ worked-out examples. The learning environment was developed according to approved design criteria. The topics that are addressed in the learning environment were chosen in response to the results of a needs assessment that analysed schoolbooks and classroom videos, and took interviews with teachers into account. In experiments as well as in several teacher trainings on example-based learning, the computer-based learning environment was evaluated and improved accordingly. On a more general level, our research and development project showed that a computer-based learning programme could be a sensible tool that supports follow-up work in teacher training contexts.},

abstract = {This study investigated the views about constructivist instruction and personal epistemology of the secondary earth science teachers in Taiwan. Participants were assessed through a paper-and-pencil survey and a Learning environment preference questionnaire (LEP) designed to explore personal epistemology. On a five-point Likert scale, teachers, on average, showed a neutral agreement on constructivist instruction. The content analysis suggested that teachers held alternative views about the nature of the constructivist instruction. LEP scores were found to be statistically associated with gender, education, current teaching level and years of teaching; the score distribution indicated that most teachers had not developed a constructivist-compatible epistemology. By one-way ANOVA, it was suggested that views about the constructivist instruction were aligned with personal epistemology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Level-specific model fit evaluation can address this limitation and is more informative in locating the source of lack of model fit. We proposed level-specific test statistics for the test of overall model fit, comparative fit index, and root mean squared error of approximation using partially saturated models, and we also considered another level-specific approach proposed by Yuan and Bentler (2007). A simulation study showed that the standard approach failed to detect the lack of fit at the group level. The fit indexes produced by the level-specific approaches both successfully detected the lack of model fit at each level. There were only minor differences in the performance of the 2 level-specific approaches.},

Validity is associated with the interpretation assigned to test scores rather than with the test scores or the test. The interpretation involves an argument leading from the scores to score-based statements or decisions, and the validity of the interpretation depends on the plausibility of this interpretive argument. The interpretive arguments associated with most test-score interpretations involve multiple inferences and assumptions. An explicit recognition of the inferences and assumptions in the interpretive argument makes it possible to identify the kinds of evidence needed to evaluate the argument. Evidence for the inferences and assumptions in the argument supports the interpretation, and evidence against any part of the argument casts doubt on the interpretation.

abstract = {In recent years, the number of studies using a cluster-randomized design has grown dramatically. In addition, the cluster-randomized crossover design has been touted as a methodological advance that can increase efficiency of cluster-randomized studies in certain situations. While the cluster-randomized crossover trial has become a popular tool, standards of design, analysis, reporting and implementation have not been established for this emergent design. We address one particular aspect of cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover trial design: estimating statistical power. We present a general framework for estimating power via simulation in cluster-randomized studies with or without one or more crossover periods. We have implemented this framework in the clusterPower software package for R, freely available online from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Our simulation framework is easy to implement and users may customize the methods used for data analysis. We give four examples of using the software in practice. The clusterPower package could play an important role in the design of future cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover studies. This work is the first to establish a universal method for calculating power for both cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized clinical trials. More research is needed to develop standardized and recommended methodology for cluster-randomized crossover studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This article focuses on the evaluation of homework behavior of 8th-grade high school students from the perspective of self-regulated learning. For this purpose, the extracurricular learning behavior was analysed by means of process data collected daily over seven weeks (n=115) and afterwards, the adequacy of the underlying process model of self-regulation (Schmitz, 2001; Schmitz {\{}{\&}{\}} Wiese, 2006) was verified. The results provide evidence for the adequacy of the process model of self-regulation for the extracurricular context. Furthermore, the process survey led to precise and exact information about specific aspects of self-regulation regarding the extracurricular learning behavior. In this connection, this article addresses, in particular, emotions during learning and learning time (the average learning time, the process of preparation for a class test, the relationship between starting time of homework and the effectiveness of learning).

abstract = {AbstractReceiving feedback from students has become a normal part of life for university teachers worldwide. This puts pressure on them from several sides and may be an influential factor that leads them to tailor their teaching to students' preferences. The aim of this study was to investigate teachers' perceptions of student feedback and how it affects their teaching choices. A survey was sent out to all teachers at the School of Business, Economics and Law at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The study found that student feedback is perceived positively by university teachers, has a large impact on their teaching and helps improve courses. Student feedback pushes teaching in the direction of fewer lectures and more tutorials, seminars and case studies. Teachers receiving negative student feedback experience more negative feelings related to the feedback, and are also more likely to introduce unjustified changes to their teaching in order to please students. These teachers also tend to have less teaching experience. However, a very large majority of teachers have a high level of professional pride and integrity and do not make (as they perceive them) unjustified changes to their teaching.},

abstract = {Over the years, research on students' epistemological beliefs has resulted in a growing common understanding but there are still some major points of discussion. Especially, the lack of consensus on the context-general and/or context-specific nature of epistemological beliefs deserves our attention. We argue that research in the field today is mainly characterized by a top-down approach that investigates students' domain-specific beliefs from a general epistemological perspective. Alternatively, we report on one of our studies as well as some other research that takes a bottom-up approach starting from students' domain-specific belief systems and analyzing their epistemic dimensions. Results of these studies point to the highly domain-specific nature of students' beliefs about knowledge and knowing. Therefore, a conceptual distinction between students' general epistemological beliefs and the epistemic dimensions of domain-related belief systems is recommended as a more appropriate way to address the context-general-context-specific discussion on epistemological beliefs. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The epistemological belief system approach to personal epistemology is distinguished from previous research by the following: (a) the addition of beliefs about learning, (b) the identification of distinct beliefs, (c) the consideration of asynchronous development, (d) the acknowledgment of need for balance, (e) the introduction of belief nomenclature, and (f) the introduction of quantitative assessment. The rationale of these features is discussed. The extended conceptualization of epistemological beliefs as a system within other systems is proposed.

abstract = {This book describes ggplot2, a new data visualization package for R that uses the insights from Leland Wilkison's Grammar of Graphics to create a powerful and flexible system for creating data graphics. With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome, publication-quality plots, with automatic legends created from the plot specification superpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots to name a few) from different data sources, with automatically adjusted common scales add customisable smoothers that use the powerful modelling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalised additive models and robust regression save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements, and that can easily be applied to multiple plots approach your graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying their data in an informative and attractive way. You will need some basic knowledge of R (i.e. you should be able to get your data into R), but ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. Hadley Wickham is an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Rice University, and is interested in developing computational and cognitive tools for making data preparation, visualization, and analysis easier. He has developed 15 R packages and in 2006 he won the John Chambers Award for Statistical Computing for his work on the ggplot and reshape R packages.},

So much so that there has been speculation as to whether human behavior can be truly characterized as normatively rational (see, e.g., Stanovich, 1999, 2009 ). In this chapter, we describe the challenges of thinking and reasoning scientifically. Specifically, we make a case that a central challenge in developing students' reasoning is developing their epistemic cognition. Next, we discuss the promotion of both conceptual knowledge and conceptual change in science. We conclude with an overview of pedagogical approaches that can support the development of epistemic cognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

To articulate and justify this conception, Shulman responds to four questions: what are the sources of the knowledge base for teaching? in what terms can these sources be conceptualized? what are the processes of pedagogical reasoning and action? and what are the implications for teaching policy and educational reform? the answer informed by philosophy, psychology, and a growing body of casework based on young and experienced practitioners- go far beyong current reform assumptions and initiatives. The outcome for educational practitioners, scholars, and policymakers is a major redirection in how teaching is to be understood and teachers are to be trained and evaluated.},

The current study examined how burnout and efficacy relate to student disciplinary actions (e.g., referrals to the principal and suspensions) and referrals for school-based support services (e.g., student support and special education), while adjusting for school-, teacher-, and student-level variables. Data were collected during the fall and spring of a single school year from 491 teachers regarding 9,795 students at 31 elementary schools. Contrary to expectations, having low teacher efficacy in the fall was associated with a reduction in student referrals to the student support team. Also unexpectedly, teachers with high burnout in the fall were less likely to have students who received an out-of-school suspension by the spring. These findings enhance our understanding of the teacher factors that influence student outcomes and may inform the development of screenings and teacher-targeted interventions.

Two studies examined this illusion of explanatory depth with 48 children each in grades K, 2, and 4, and also explored adults' ratings of the children's explanations. Children judged their understanding of mechanical devices (Study 1) and procedures (Study 2). Second and fourth graders showed a clear illusion of explanatory depth for devices, recognizing the inaccuracy of their initial impressions after providing explanations.

abstract = {Highlights • Teachers are more inclined to regard students as active participants in the process of acquiring knowledge than to see the teacher's main role as the transmission of information and demonstration of " correct solutions " . This is most true in northwest Europe, Scandinavia, Australia and Korea and least true in southern Europe, Brazil and Malaysia where teachers fall between the two views. • In the classroom, teachers in all countries put greater emphasis on ensuring that learning is well structured than on student-oriented activities which give them more autonomy. Both of these teaching practices are emphasised more than enhanced learning activities such as project work. This pattern is true in every country. • Co-operation by teachers in all countries more commonly takes the form of exchanging and co-ordinating ideas and information than direct professional collaboration such as team teaching. • At least half of teachers in most countries spend over 80{\%} of their lesson time on teaching and learning. However, one in four teachers in most countries lose at least 30{\%} of their lesson time, and some lose more than half, through disruptions and administrative tasks. This is closely associated with the classroom disciplinary climate. Country and school differences in this respect are less important than differences among teachers within schools. • Almost all Norwegian teachers report better than average relationships between teachers and students. In other countries, teacher-student relationships vary considerably. Only part of this variation is related to differences among schools. Even though teacher-student relations are often seen as a feature of schools as a whole, different teachers within schools perceive them differently.},

Until now, evaluations of such systems have provided only little insight into why a particular outcome occurred. The aim of this study is to gain insight into the navigation process (what functionalities are used, and in what sequence) of e-Vita, a PHR for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), to increase the efficiency of the system and improve the long-term adherence. Log data of the first visits in the first 6 weeks after the release of a renewed version of e-Vita were analyzed to identify the usage patterns that emerge when users explore a new application. After receiving the invitation, 28{\%} of all registered users visited e-Vita. In total, 70 unique usage patterns could be identified. When users visited the education service first, 93{\%} of all users ended their session. Most users visited either 1 or 5 or more services during their first session, but the distribution of the routes was diffuse. In conclusion, log file analyses can provide valuable prompts for improving the system design of a PHR. In this way, the match between the system and its users and the long-term adherence has the potential to increase. {\textcopyright} 2014 Diabetes Technology Society.},

abstract = {The present study investigates whether epistemic cognition in moral domain (dubbed metaethical cognition) develops analogously to epistemic reasoning regarding empirical knowledge. The study's conceptual framework distinguishes two main areas of metaethical cognition (beliefs about the nature of moral judgments and conceptions of the process of moral judgment formation), and three metaethical stances (intuitionism, subjectivism, and transsubjectivism). In a sample of 200 adolescents (M 1/4 16.18 years, SD 1/4 2.41), these metaethical stances could be reliably identified by means of a semistructured interview procedure. Adolescents' metaethical stance was related to age, cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. Furthermore, significant differences in metaethical cognition were found between high school students and an expert group of university students with special training in moral philosophy. Overall, metaethical and epistemic stances were correlated substantially. Findings demonstrate that metaethical reasoning development is a structural analogue of epistemic development regarding factual knowledge. Implications for studies on moral development and for research addressing the domain specificity of epistemic reasoning development are discussed.},

First, the different aspects of students' learning experience were related: learning approaches and episte- mological beliefs (two pairs of canonical variates accounted for the significant relationships), and epistemological beliefs and study orchestrations (sophisticated beliefs emerged mainly in those participants using deep study orchestrations). Second, study orchestrations, as well as the canonical variates from epistemological beliefs and learning approaches, predicted students' academic performance. Results suggest that higher education institutions should provide scaffolding to foster the development of a mature learning experience amongst their students.},

abstract = {The Occupational Stress and Coping Inventory (AVEM; Schaarschmidt {\{}{\&}{\}} Fischer, 1996, 1997) is a diagnostic instrument comprising 11 subscales designed to measure personal and social resources used to cope with occupational demands. Cluster analyses of teacher data identified four types (the {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}healthy-ambitious{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} type; the {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}unambitious{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} type; risk type A: the {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}excessively-ambitious{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} type; risk type B: the {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}resigned{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} type), who are assumed to differ in terms of both the occupational stress they experience and instructional behavior. Previous research seeking to validate this typology has drawn on teachers' self-report data. The present article examines the extent to which the stress experienced by mathematics teachers is reflected in students' reports of these teachers' instructional behavior. Data were obtained from a sample of 314 ninth-grade classes and their mathematics teachers in the context of the German national extension to the PISA 2003 study. The results indicate, first, that the Schaarschmidt {\{}{\&}{\}} Fischer typology can be replicated in the present sample. Second, on four of the six dimensions of instructional quality examined, significant differences were found between the four types, indicating that students perceive the instruction provided by teachers under stress to be of lower quality.

Second, based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, we examine the concept of cognitive overload in which the learner's intended cognitive processing exceeds the learner's available cognitive capacity. Third, we examine five overload scenarios. For each overload scenario, we offer one or two theory-based suggestions for reducing cognitive load, and we summarize our research results aimed at testing the effectiveness of each suggestion. Overall, our analysis shows that cognitive load is a central consideration in the design of multimedia instruction.},

abstract = {The impact of two types of written feedback (process-oriented, grade-oriented) on changes in mathematics achievement, interest and self-evaluation was compared---with a particular focus on the mediating role of feedback's perceived usefulness. Participants, 146 ninth graders (aged 14 to 17 years), were assigned to either a process-oriented or a grade-oriented experimental feedback condition. They worked on mathematics tests, received feedback on their test results and completed surveys measuring feedback's perceived usefulness, interest and self-evaluation. Results of path analysis showed that process-oriented feedback was perceived as more useful than grade-oriented feedback and that feedback's perceived usefulness had a positive effect on changes in achievement and interest. Consistent with this, process-oriented feedback had a greater positive indirect effect than grade-oriented feedback on changes in mathematics achievement and interest via its perceived usefulness. There were no such effects on changes in self-evaluation. Potential explanations for these findings, educational implications and possible directions for future research are discussed.

abstract = {The beliefs that individuals hold about knowledge and knowing have been the focus of a growing body of work on "personal epistemology." There has been general agreement among researchers about a developmental trajectory of epistemological understanding that takes place in adolescence and adulthood. Rarely has this research included children, however, and we know little about the origins of epistemological awareness or its early development. A separate group of researchers have investigated children's "theory of mind," or the ability to understand others' beliefs, actions, and desires, with primary attention to the onset of this cognitive achievement between the ages of 3 and 5. This article reviews the theoretical foundation for a proposed relation between these constructs, and reports on an exploratory investigation with 3-5 year olds, in which epistemological level was significantly related to theory of mind ability. Results are discussed in relation to a general timeline depicting the development of children's beliefs about knowledge and knowing, a process that involves an ongoing tension between objective and subjective perspectives. We propose that the trajectory of epistemological development be expanded to include an initial period of egocentric subjectivity that characterizes epistemological thinking prior to the achievement of theory of mind. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Cognitive load research has shown that learning from worked-out examples, in comparison to problem solving, is very effective during the initial stages of cognitive skill acquisition. In later stages, however, solving problems is superior. In this contribution, theoretical analyses of different types of cognitive load and their changes over the stages of skill acquisition are presented. Two basic arguments are put forth: (a) Intrinsic cognitive load gradually decreases so that a gradual increase of problem-solving demands is possible without inducing cognitive overload. (b) In contrast to the earlier stages, different learner activities during the later stages constitute either germane or extraneous load, because different instructional goals are to be achieved. Based on these analyses, we propose a fading procedure in which problem-solving elements are successively integrated into example study until the learners are expected to solve problems on their own. Empirical evidence supporting this fading procedure is provided, and future research is proposed that focuses on how to ensure that the fading procedure is adaptive to the learners' prior knowledge levels.

abstract = {Using data from the international Teacher Education and Development Study: Learning to Teach Mathematics (TEDS-M), the measurement equivalence of teachers' beliefs across countries is investigated for the case of ‘mathematics-as-a fixed-ability'. Measurement equivalence is a crucial topic in all international large-scale assessments and widely undervalued for non-achievement measures. Although it is well known that cultural differences may affect response styles or meaning of constructs, and although comparability is often not specifically examined, international large-scale assessment results are typically compared across countries in terms of scale means. Full scalar invariance is typically unattainable in such international assessments due to their sheer size and local item dependence issues. To deal with both challenges, a Bayesian approach is introduced that uses informative priors to define elastic equivalence constraints to investigate the comparability of TEDS-M future teachers' beliefs under a working assumption of approximate measurement invariance. Substantively, a clear pattern of three groups of countries emerged that corroborates preliminary findings in other studies for other teacher beliefs. Future mathematics teachers in Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines believed more strongly that mathematics is a fixed ability, whereas the USA, Chile, Norway, Germany and Switzerland believed less strongly in this. Taiwan, Singapore, Poland and Russia took the middle ground. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Personal epistemology has typically been conceptualized in one of two primary ways: as a cognitive developmental process or as a system of beliefs. The approach that is elaborated here is to conceive of epistemological understanding as a metacognitive process that activates epistemic theories, a multidimensional set of interrelated beliefs about knowledge and knowing. Building on the work of Flavell (1979), K. S. Kitchener (1983), and Kuhn (1999b), this article describes the rationale for conceptualizing epistemological awareness at the metacognitive level, delineates the nature of this construct, and describes how this directs methodological choices for research. This is discussed in light of a recent study of students' online searching for a simulated science assignment, investigated through the use of think-aloud protocols. Exploring students' thought processes during online searching allows examination of personal epistemology not as a decontextualized set of beliefs, but as an activated, situated aspect of cognition that influences the knowledge construction process.

abstract = {Observer ratings are often used to measure instructional quality. They are, however, usually based on observations gathered over short periods of time. Few studies have attempted to determine whether these periods are sufficient to provide reliable measures of instructional quality. Using generalizability theory, this study investigates (a) how three dimensions of instructional quality - classroom management, personal learning support, and cognitive activation of students - vary between the lessons of a specific teacher, and (b) how many lessons per teacher are necessary to establish sufficiently reliable measures of these dimensions. Analyses are based on ratings of five lessons for 38 teachers. Classroom management and personal learning support were stable across lessons, whereas cognitive activation showed high variability. Consequently, one lesson per teacher suffices to measure classroom management and personal learning support, whereas nine lessons would be needed for cognitive activation. The importance of advancing our theoretical understanding of cognitive activation is discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Research about the relationship between teachers' scientific epistemological views (SEVs) and science instruction is often an important issue for many science educators. This study, by collecting research data from four Taiwanese science teachers, their students, and classroom observations, was carried out to examine the coherences between teachers' SEVs and their (1)teaching beliefs,(2) instructional practices, (3) students' SEVs, and (4) students' perceptions toward actual science learning environments. The findings suggested adequate coherences between teachers' SEVs and their teaching beliefs as well as instructional practices. The teachers with relatively positivist-aligned SEVs tended to draw attention to students' science scores in tests and allocate more instructional time on teacher-directed lectures, tutorial problem practices, or in-class examinations, implying a more passive or rote perspective about learning science. In contrast, teachers with constructivist-oriented SEVs tended to focus on student understanding and application of scientific concepts and they adopted more time on student inquiry activities or interactive discussion. These findings are quite consistent with the results about the coherence between teachers' SEVs and students' perceptions toward science learning environments, suggesting that the constructivist-oriented SEVs appeared to foster the creation of more constructivist-oriented science learning environments. Finally, although this study provided some evidence that teachers' SEVs were likely related to their students' SEVs, the teachers' SEVs and those of their students were not obviously coherent.

The role of occupational engagement and resilience as two important work-related self-regulatory dimensions that predict occupational well-being and teachers' instructional performance in the classroom was investigated. In Part 1 of the study, self-regulatory data from 1,789 German mathematics teachers were subjected to a latent profile analysis, yielding four self-regulatory types (healthy-ambitious, unambitious, excessively ambitious, and resigned) that differed significantly on emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. In Part 2, the association between teachers' self-regulatory type and instructional performance was examined in a subsample of 318 teachers. Results showed that teachers' self-regulatory type predicted the quality of instruction in three of the four aspects of instructional performance examined. Moreover, teachers' self-regulatory type was systematically linked to differences in students' motivation. No association was found between teacher self-regulation and student achievement.

Adults have a strong sense of how knowledge is clustered in the world around them and use that sense to access additional information, defer to relevant experts, and ground their own incomplete understandings. One prominent way of clustering knowledge is by disciplines similar to those that comprise the natural and social sciences. Seven studies explored an emerging sense of these discipline-based ways of clustering of knowledge. Even 5-year-olds could cluster knowledge in a manner roughly corresponding to the departments of natural and social sciences in a university, doing so without any explicit awareness of those academic disciplines. But this awareness is fragile early on and competes with other ways of clustering knowledge. Over the next few years, children come to see discipline-based clusters as having a privileged status, one that may be linked to increasingly sophisticated assumptions about essences for natural kinds. Possible mechanisms for this developmental shift are examined.},

abstract = {This study examined relations between teachers' perception of the school context, teacher burnout, and teacher job satisfaction. Participants were 563 Norwegian teachers in elementary school and middle school. Four aspects of teachers' perception of the school context (supervisory support, time pressure, relations to parents, and autonomy) and three dimensions of teacher burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment) were measured. The data were analyzed by means of structural equation modelling using the AMOS 5 program. Teachers' job satisfaction was directly related to two of the dimensions of burnout (emotional exhaustion and reduced personal accomplishment) and indirectly related to all aspects of the school context, through emotional exhaustion and reduced personal accomplishment. The three dimensions of burnout were differently related to the school context variables. Emotional exhaustion was most strongly related to time pressure whereas depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment were most strongly related to teachers' relations with parents. Implications for both research and educational practices are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Dimensions of Internet-specific epistemic beliefs were found to explain unique variance in Internet-based search, help-seeking, and self-regulatory strategies, respectively. Specifically, students who emphasized that course-related knowledge located on the Internet consisted of specific facts and details perceived Internet-search and evaluation of search results to be less problematic and reported on more help-seeking and use of self-regulatory strategies during Internet-based learning. Moreover, students believing that Internet-based knowledge claims need to be checked against other sources, reason, and prior knowledge were reportedly more likely to use self-regulatory strategies when using the Internet during coursework. The results are discussed in light of what characterizes the Internet as a knowledge source.},

To estimate the effects of such institutional differences in the face of country heterogeneity, we employ an international differences-in-differences approach. We identify tracking effects by comparing differences in outcome between primary and secondary school across tracked and non-tracked systems. Six international student assessments provide eight pairs of achievement contrasts for between 18 and 26 cross-country comparisons. The results suggest that early tracking increases educational inequality. While less clear, there is also a tendency for early tracking to reduce mean performance.},

As a first step toward examining studying through metacognitive lenses, we present a general typology that delineates facets of academic tasks in general, including studying tasks. Then, we use this typology to characterize four distinguishable but recursively linked stages of studying: task definition, goal setting and planning, enacting study tactics and strategies, and metacognitively adapting studying. Next, we develop connections between our typology for studying and models of metacognitive monitoring, metacognitive control, and self-regulated learning. With this backdrop, we then survey select research that highlights metacognitive activities in each of the four stages of studying. Finally, we summarize our model of studying and offer suggestions for next steps in research on studying as a complex, self-regulated learning event.

abstract = {(from the chapter) The perspective that teaching requires doing {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}whatever it takes,{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} knowledge about a variety of topics, and the ability to use knowledge in multiple ways and settings, suggests that teaching is a very complex task. Thus, the beliefs that underscore this perspective on teaching must be equally complex. In this chapter we explore how preservice and practicing teachers articulate their beliefs about teaching knowledge. By teaching knowledge we mean any knowledge used to facilitate the practice of teaching. Several theorists, including Shulman (1987), Elbaz (1983), and Grossman (1990) have attempted to articulate the knowledge base for teaching. That is, what is it that teachers know that allows them to be successful in facilitating student learning? Although these two strands of research, teachers' beliefs and teachers' knowledge, have added greatly to our understanding of teaching and learning, the lack of overlap between these fields is surprising. For instance, studies of preservice teacher beliefs about knowledge have tended to address their general knowledge beliefs (e.g., Ravindran et al, 2005), focused on their beliefs about knowledge in specific academic domain (e.g., mathematics: Gill et al, 2004), or examined the domain generality-specificity of teachers' knowledge (e.g., Olafson and Schraw, 2006). Discussions of teacher knowledge rarely query teachers about the knowledge that they need for teaching and few probe teachers' beliefs about the nature of such knowledge. To address this issue, we have undertaken an examination of teachers' beliefs that spans these fields of study and connects to the existing literature on students' knowledge beliefs (Buehl and Fives, 2009; Fives and Buehl, 2005; Fives and Buehl, 2008). In this work, we have developed a framework for understanding teachers' beliefs that is grounded in previous research yet reflective of the perspectives held by preservice and practicing teachers. Through our examination of their responses and attempts to develop a framework that integrates the voices of teachers with the research literature, we have come to realize the complexity of these beliefs. Herein, we overview our framework, which is the culmination of several studies, and highlight critical methodological issues that have arisen for us in our attempts to understand these beliefs. We also acknowledge the current theoretical and empirical literature that has influenced our thinking and we relate our emergent framework back to this literature.

In what terms can these sources be conceptualized? What are the processes of pedagogical reasoning and action? and What are the implications for teaching policy and educational reform? The answers --- informed by philosophy, psychology, and a growing body of casework based on young and experienced practitioners --- go far beyond current reform assumptions and initiatives. The outcome for educational practitioners, scholars, and policymakers is a major redirection in how teaching is to be understood and teachers are to be trained and evaluated.

Separate factor analyses of 6 groups of courses each clearly identified the evaluation factors that SEEQ was designed to measure, demonstrating the replicability and generality of the factors. The SEEQ factors were then correlated with a set of 16 student/course/instructor characteristics (e.g., class size, expected grades, teacher rank) in each group of courses. These correlations were typically small, and proportion of variance in the ratings that could be predicted by the combined set of characteristics (based on stepwise multiple regression) varied between .08 and .20 in the 6 groups of courses. Most of the predictable variance in each group of courses could be explained by the same 4 characteristics; more favorable ratings were associated with higher prior subject interest, higher expected grades, higher levels of workload/difficulty, and a higher percentage of students taking a course for general interest. Discussion indicates that the interpretation of these effects as a bias to student ratings is unwarranted, and alternative approaches are presented.

The purpose of this methodological/ substantive study is to apply a multiple-level growth modeling approach to the long-term stability of students' evaluations of teaching effectiveness (SETs). For a diverse cohort of 195 teachers who were evaluated continuously over 13 years (6,024 classes, an average of 30.9 classes per teacher), there was little evidence that teachers became either more or less effective with added experience. This stability of SETs generalized reasonably well over undergraduate- and graduate-level courses, early career teachers, and teachers who differed substantially in terms of their teaching effectiveness overall. Whereas there were substantial individual differences between teachers in terms of their teaching effectiveness, these individual differences were also highly stable over time. Although highly supportive of the use of SETs for many purposes, the results provide a serious challenge for existing programs that assume that SET feedback alone is sufficient to improve teaching effectiveness.},

abstract = {Students' Evaluations of Educational Quality (SEEQ) measures distinct dimensions of teaching effectiveness, but some researchers argue that student ratings should be considered as a relatively unidimensional construct or a single global hierarchical factor that incorporates distinct 1st-order factors. Previous research was used to derive higher-order models positing 1, 2, 3, and 4 higher-order factors. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of responses of SEEQ supported the 9 1st-order factors that SEEQ is designed to measure and the model with 4 2nd-order factors. For even the model with 4 higher-order factors, much of the true score variance in 1st-order factors was not explained by the higher-order factors. The study demonstrates that the SEEQ responses cannot be adequately explained by one or even a few summary scores and illustrates the application of hierarchical CFA.},

abstract = {Students' evaluations of teaching effectiveness (SETEs) are weakly related—negatively—to teaching experience and age according to Feldman's (1983) comprehensive review of cross-sectional studies. Cross-sectional studies, however, provide a weak basis for inferring the future ratings of less experienced teachers or the past ratings of more experienced teachers. Considered here are ratings of 6024 classes taught by a diverse cohort of 195 teachers representing 31 academic departments who were evaluated continuously over a 13-year period using the same multidimensional Students' Evaluations of Educational Quality instrument. For both undergraduate and graduate level courses, there were almost no changes over time for any of the nine content-specific dimensions, the overall course rating, or the overall instructor rating. The findings were consistent for teachers who had little, moderate, or substantial amounts of teaching experience at the start of the study. These results are important because this is apparently the only study to examine the stability of faculty ratings using a longitudinal design with a large and diverse group of teachers over such a long period of time.},

abstract = {In educational research, characteristics of the learning environment (e.g., social climate, instructional quality, goal orientation) are often assessed via student reports, and their associations with outcome variables such as school achievement or student motivation then tested. However, studying the effects of the learning environment presents a series of methodological challenges. This article discusses three crucial elements in research that uses student reports to gauge the impact of the learning environment on student outcomes. First, from a conceptual point of view, it is argued that ratings aggregated at the relevant level (e.g., class or school level), and not individual student ratings, are of primary interest in these studies. Second, the reliability of aggregated student ratings must be routinely assessed before these perceptions are related to outcome variables. Third, researchers conducting multilevel analyses need to make very clear which centering option was chosen for the predictor variables. This article shows that conclusions about the impact of learning environments can be substantially affected by the choice of a specific centering option for the individual student ratings. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Recently graduated university students from all Australian Universities rate their overall departmental and university experiences (DUEs), and their responses (N = 44,932, 41 institutions) are used by the government to benchmark departments and universities. We evaluate this DUE strategy of rating overall departments and universities rather than individual teachers, and we juxtapose it with the traditional use of student ratings to evaluate individual teachers (SETs). Multilevel analyses of DUE overall ratings were not able to discriminate well between universities or departments-few universities or departments differed significantly from the grand mean. Although the a priori 5-factor structure for this DUE instrument was reasonably well-defined at the individual student level, none of the 5 factors separately or in combination discriminated well between departments or universities. In contrast to this pattern of results, we review studies showing that SETs do reliably differentiate between teachers and are valid in relation to many criteria of effective teaching. However, casual reviews of these research literatures should not use this support for SETs to justify the use of DUE-type strategies. We conclude that DUE-type ratings should be used with great caution, if at all, and should not be seen as an alternative to SETs.},

abstract = {(from the chapter) Differentiates among indices of agreement, reliability, and non-independence in organizational multilevel research and provides an overview of what each measure reveals about the group-level properties of one's data. Particular attention is devoted to the concept of non-independence and to the relationship between one form of the intraclass correlation coefficient and eta-squared. The 2nd purpose of this chapter is to extend the discussion of agreement, reliability, and non-independence from an exclusive focus on validating one's measurement model to a broader focus that includes testing substantive models and detecting emergent phenomena. In the discussion of bottom-up processes, particular attention is paid to a category that the author defines as "fuzzy" composition processes.
